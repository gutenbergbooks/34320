<br>
Retired agent Michael Vance is approached for help on the same day by an old
KGB adversary and a brilliant and beautiful NSA code breaker. While their
problems seem at first glance to be different, Vance soon learns he’s got a
potentially lethal tiger by the tail – a Japanese tiger. A secret agreement
between a breakaway wing of the Russian military and the Yakuza, the Japanese
crime lords, bears the potential to shift the balance or world power. The
catalyst is a superplane that skims the edge of space – the ultimate in
death-dealing potential. In a desperate union with an international force of
intelligence mavericks, with megabillions and global supremacy at stake, Vance
has only a few days to bring down a conspiracy that threatens to ignite nuclear
Armageddon.<br>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>“Hoover’s adept handling
of convincing detail enhances this entertaining thriller as his characters deal
and double-deal their way through settings ranging from the Acropolis to the
inside of a spacecraft. Michael Vance, formerly of the CIA, is on his way to an
archeological dig when some old friends show up. First comes KGB agent Alex
Novosty, caught laundering money that the KGB claims was embezzled – and he
wants Michael to take charge of the hot funds. Then National Security Agency
cryptographer Eva Borodin (who is Michael’s ex-lover) appears with an
undecipherable but dangerous computer file: the co-worker who gave her the file
has since vanished. Heavies from a Japanese crime syndicate attack Michael and
Eva, who are rescued by Alex, but it looks like Alex and the syndicate aren’t
complete strangers. Moreover, the mysterious Daedalus Corporation seems to be a
link between Alex’s money and Eva’s file. As Michael is drawn into this deadly
web, he realizes there is a secret agreement between the Russians and the
Japanese – and it has nothing to do with tea-brewing customs.”</span></i></p>

poured into his eyes and his lungs were plastered against his diaphragm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He could sense the blood draining from his cerebral
vascular system, his consciousness trying to drift away. He knew that against
these forces the human heart could no longer pump enough oxygen to the brain.
Already he was seeing the telltale black dots at the edge of his vision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He leaned back in the seat to lower his head another few
millimeters, then grasped for the pressure control on his G-suit, the
inflatable corset that squeezed critical blood paths. He ignored the pain as
its internal pressure surged, gripping his torso and lower legs like a vise and
forcing blood upward to counter the accumulation at his feet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

the snow, literally pushing his blood higher—the best maneuver of all. He liked

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

forward the second blue switch behind the throttle quadrant, initiating the
simulated hydrogen feed to the outboard scramjet tridents, portside and
starboard. Acceleration was still increasing as the flashing green number on
the video screens in front of his eyes scrolled past Mach 4.6, over four and a
half times the speed of sound, already faster than any air- breathing vehicle
had ever flown.</span></p>

Mach 4.8, raising the fuel-injector strut temperature of the scramjets to the

failed to stabilize and initiated auto shutdown, he would flame out—at almost
twenty-five hundred miles per hour.</span></p>

had a demand of his own. &quot;Report scramjet profile.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The velocity scrolling on the right side of his helmet screen
was about to pass through the barrier. Strut temperature was stabilizing. With
engines in the scramjet mode, the vehicle should be able to push right on out
to Mach 25, seventeen thousand miles per hour. From there it was only a short
hop to low orbit. If—</span></p>

compression nominal</i>. The liquid air cycle equipment would be using the
cryogenic hydrogen fuel to chill and liquefy the rush of incoming air; oxygen
would then be injected into the scramjets at pressures impossible to achieve in
conventional engines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With a sigh he eased back lightly on the throttle grip in his
left hand. As he felt the weight on his chest recede, the pressure in his
G-suit automatically let up. He smiled to think that a less experienced pilot
would now be slumped in his seat, head lolling side to side, eyes wide open and
blank, his bloodless brain dreaming of a lunar landscape. He knew; he'd been there
often enough himself. In the old days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

It was a crow of triumph, a challenge to every male ape in the forest. Yuri Andreevich
Androv lived for this, and only felt alive when he'd just pushed his body to
the limit. He needed it, lusted for it. It was all he'd ever really cared
about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was, he knew, his primal need to dominate his world. He
knew that, but so what? Other men merely dreamed it, played at it—in games,
business, even politics. He did it. And he fully intended to go on doing it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Roll down her audio, dammit,&quot; he yelled into his

color:windowtext'>&quot;She's supposed to,&quot; a radio voice sounded back in
his ear. &quot;Ramenskoye says all test pilots—you included, my friend—pay more
attention to a female voice.&quot; A laugh. &quot;Come to <i>matya</i>,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd like to see her and—<i>Nayarevayet!</i>—just
once.&quot; He smiled in spite of himself as the tunnel widened more and the
screens before his eyes began to recolor, pale hues gradually darkening to
primary shades. The blood was returning to his brain. Acceleration was
stabilizing now, down to 4.7 G's.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's been so long, I probably wouldn't notice.&quot;
That's what he really needed now—a woman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You would, believe me,&quot; the radio continued.
&quot;By the way, congratulations. Your alpha was right across the oscilloscope,

  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Petra</span><span style='font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shut off the tape, and cut the 'comrade' crap,&quot; he</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>barked back.
&quot;Sergei, I nearly lost it there at nine point five.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

he snapped again, still wired with tension. &quot;Can we get another fifteen
percent tilt out of this damned seat, help lower my head. There're no windows
anyway, so who cares where I'm looking?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We can send a memo to Engineering,&quot; the radio

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell them they'd better make fucking time. Say I want
it done.&quot; Not enough time? What in hell was going on?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He took one last look at the high-definition video screens—one
for each eye—inside the helmet that would be the vehicle's
&quot;windscreen,&quot; then flipped the snap and began shoving it up. He hated
the damned thing, thought it made him look like a giant high-tech moth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shall we power-down the centrifuge now?&quot; the voice
continued, unfazed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Take it down. I'm ready for lunch. And a bottle of
juice. <i>'Peit budu ya!'</i>&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;I read you,&quot; the radio voice chuckled
once more, knowing there wasn't any vodka to be had for a hundred miles around
the facility. Reports were the project director had heard too many stories
about Russian drunkenness and somehow always forgot to include liquor in the
supply requisition. &quot;I hear there's borscht again in the mess today. Petyr
just came in from the North Quadrant. Said it tastes like piss. Bastards still
haven't learned—&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Pomnyu, pomnyu</i>.&quot; He found himself longing
for real food, seemingly impossible to produce here. Just like a drink.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He waited a few seconds longer, till the huge white
centrifuge had come to a complete stop, then shoved down the metal hatch
release and stepped out. He looked up at the high-impact glass partition of the
instrument room, waved to the medical team, and began unzipping his flight
suit. It was only half open by the time the technicians marched in, anxious to
remove quickly the rubber</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>suction cups
and wires he was wearing on his head and chest, the instrumentation probes for
their body monitor system. They wanted to reclaim them before he ripped them
off, something he frequently had been known to do. Androv always said he was
there to fly whatever plane nobody else had the balls to, not take a physical,
so he wanted the goddam things off, and fast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Air Force Major Yuri Andreevich Androv was thirty- seven,
tall, with the studied swagger all Soviet test pilots seemed to acquire after a
few years. His dark eyes and hair were set off by a high forehead and long,
lean cheeks, and behind those cynical eyes lurked a penetrating intelligence.
There was something else too, the most vital attribute a test pilot can have: a
perfect, natural integration of the two sides of his brain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Soviet medical studies had shown that the best pilots were
artists, because handling a plane at three times the speed of sound was
primarily a function of the intuitive right side of the brain, the side that
provides the instincts, the seat-of-the-pants judgment. The left brain, in
contrast, handled a pilot's rational functions—it was his data management
system, his computer.</span></p>

his brain started getting its signals mixed, when it was no longer sure which
side was in control. They called it the biology barrier. The result of
information overload in a stress situation, it could lead to a total breakdown.
The brain went haywire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yuri Androv was one of the few Soviet test pilots who never
reached the biology barrier. He was, in fact, the best.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He knew that his gift was one of the reasons he had been
specially selected for this project. Another was experience. Over the years,
he'd flown them all—the Tupolev Blackjack, the MiG 25 Foxbat, even the
ultra-secret new MiG 31 Foxhound. But this hydrogen-fueled, scramjet-powered
monster opened the door to another world. Above Mach 5, you were no longer
merely supersonic, you were hypersonic—where no air-breathing vehicle had ever
ventured.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Could it be done? He had to admit the technology was
awesome—all the aerodynamic design by supercomputer, the new ceramic composites
for the leading edges, the Mach 13 burst-tests in the hypersonic wind tunnel,
the scramjet static-test power-ups at the aeropropulsion facility. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was supposedly just a space-research vehicle, for
godsake. But it had twelve engines. And whereas the MiG 25, the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>USSR</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s fastest fighter-interceptor, topped out well under
two thousand miles per hour, this space-age creation was capable,
theoretically, of speeds almost ten times that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The schedule agreed upon called for the certification of both
the prototypes in their lower-speed, turboramjet mode, and then the
commencement of hypersonic flight tests in the scramjet mode. That second phase
wasn't supposed to begin for three months.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But now the project director had ordered the test program
accelerated, demanding the hypersonic test flights begin immediately with the
one prototype now certified—in ten days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe, just maybe, it could be done. Of course, everybody
else would be sitting safely in Flight Control there in the East Quadrant when
he kicked in the scramjets at sixty thousand feet. His ass would be the one in
the cockpit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was the riskiest project of his life. Until the operational
shakedown, nobody actually knew whether or not those damned scramjets would
produce a standing shock wave in their combustion chamber, creating a
supersonic &quot;compressor&quot; the way the supercomputer promised they
would.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And what about somebody's brilliant idea of using the plane's
liquid hydrogen fuel as coolant for the leading edges, to dissipate the intense
heat of hypersonic flight? Had to do it, they claimed. Computer says there's no
other way. But that was about as &quot;brilliant&quot; as filling your car
radiator with frozen jet fuel! He'd be flying in a cocoon of liquid hydrogen .
. . and, even scarier, he'd be doing it blind, with no windscreen. If he burned
up he'd have to watch it on television.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He glanced back one last time at the white centrifuge, a
fifty-foot propeller with the simulated cockpit on one blade and a
counterbalancing weight on the other. The centrifuge itself was pure white
enamel, spotless, just like the room. A little honest Russian dirt would
actually have made him feel better. Riding in that &quot;cockpit&quot; was like
being strapped inside a video game, all lights and nothing real.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Frowning, he shrugged and passed on through the door, greeted
the milling technicians, and tossed his crumpled flight suit toward two medics
from the foreign team who caught it in midair, bowed, and hurried it into the
medical lab for . . . the devil take it, he didn't know and he didn't care.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The fluorescent-lit hall was crowded with white-shirted
technicians returning from the morning's test in Number One, the big hypersonic
wind tunnel. Everybody was smiling, which told him the final run-up of the
model must have gone without a hitch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was the last segment of the revised schedule. The
hypersonic test flight was on, in eighteen days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What in hell was the sudden rush? What was everybody's real
agenda? Nobody was talking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was what really bothered him, had bothered him from the
start. This top-secret vehicle wasn't destined to be some kind of civilian
space-research platform, regardless of what anybody claimed. Who were they
fooling? The ultimate weapons delivery system had just been built here, a
high-tech behemoth that married advanced Soviet thruster and guidance
technology with a hypersonic airframe and scramjets created by the world's

color:windowtext'>&quot;You're lucky I love this spot,&quot; Vance said, gazing
out over the city. &quot;Nothing else on the planet could have got me up this
early in the morning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's the one place I thought I could persuade you to
meet me.&quot; The bearded man sighed, his dark eyes grim. The accent was Russian,
the English flawless. &quot;I have a problem, a very big problem.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Cold War's over, Alex, or maybe you hadn't
heard.&quot; He strolled on, tugging his trench coat tighter. &quot;What have
we got left to talk about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Please. We both did what we had to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I still do. Life's too short for anything else.&quot;
He turned back. &quot;Now how about telling me what's on your mind.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance was firm-muscled and lean, with the leathery skin of a
man who drank his tequila straight and preferred spending his days in the sun,
two habits that also had bestowed a network of threadlike smile lines at the
corners of his sea-blue eyes. Aleksei Ilyich Novosty had phoned him at the
Athenaeum Inter-Continental half an hour earlier, begging to meet him, saying
it was of the utmost importance. A cab was downstairs. The driver had taken him
to the old flea market at </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Monastiraki
  Square</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, where Alex's
own black limo waited. But now Novosty was playing games, and the days for KGB
games were supposed to be in the distant past. What did the man want?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My friend, give me a moment. . . .&quot; Novosty wiped
his brow, manicured nails glistening, then looked up and pointed. &quot;By the
way, I've always believed that one is the most exquisite female in the world.
That one there. What do you think?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sexy, plenty of style.&quot; Vance swept his eyes over
the figure, loving how the cloth was shaped by her breast, the vague hint of
thigh as one leg brushed against the gauze of her tunic. &quot;But the lady
next to her's a looker too. Always seemed a tough call.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Above them, the stone caryatids smiled down, their pale faces
timeless and ethereal. They were Greek statues that served as columns for the
south porch of the Erechtheum, the Ionic temple standing across from the Doric
Parthenon. Down below the steep north wall of the Acropolis, the dark-glazed
rooftops of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Athens</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, city of </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, perhaps you're right.&quot; Novosty brushed awkwardly
at his patchy stubble, searching for an opening. He knew Vance never made the
first move, always waited for the other side to show its cards. &quot;Michael,
I ... is it true you occasionally still take an assignment? I mean, outside the
usual work for ARM. I made some inquiries in </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Geneva</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> last week. The word is—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hang on. I think you're getting your team colors mixed.
I work for the other side, remember?&quot; He stooped and picked up a handful
of the grainy red soil at their feet, massaging it in his fingers and wondering
why it had taken him so long to get back here, to Greece. This was where he
belonged. This was the place, the ancient people, he still dreamed about. But
could he fit in again after so many years away? Yes, he'd make it work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Michael Vance, Jr., had the sangfroid of one who moved easily
among the decision-makers of two continents. He was to the manner born—Yale—and
he'd long since concluded it was the way man was meant to live. In years past
he'd been a field archaeologist, and a good one; then he'd had a brief
consulting stint for the CIA. These days, he lived at the Nassau Yacht Club
marina, where he moored his restored forty-four-foot Bristol racing yacht, the
Ulysses, headquarters for his three-boat charter operation. He was mortgaged to
the hilt, but he didn't really care. When things got tight, he could always
take on a quick money job for the Association of Retired Mercenaries, ARM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The situation is not necessarily what you're
thinking,&quot; Novosty pressed. &quot;So perhaps you would consider—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Whatever it is, the answer's still no. The next three
weeks are going to be spent working on a tan.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why tell Alex the facts? Today he was in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Athens</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> for only a few hours, a stopover on
the way to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Crete</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. He glanced at his watch—an old
Eterna Chronomatic, the 1946 classic he loved—and calculated that the flight
for Iraklion left in less than four hours. This time tomorrow morning he would
be looking in on the crew from the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>University</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
 of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Stuttgart</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s dig for the German Historical
Society, part of the restoration of a Minoan palace near </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Crete</span><span style='font-size:

the last thing he needed right now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then at least let's have coffee,&quot; the Russian said
finally, pointing. &quot;I brought some. There in the bag.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance needed it, to cut his hangover. Without a word he
turned to the marble steps, pried open the white paper, and reached in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Plastic.&quot; Dismay filled his voice as he lifted out
one of the smooth Styrofoam cups and examined it, like an insect. &quot;This
nails it. Game over. Our side won all the chips. Now even Greek coffee comes
American style.&quot; He frowned as he pried the white lid from the cup.
&quot;What's left?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's everywhere. Perhaps they'll wrap these statues in
cellophane next, who knows.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I fear the worst.&quot; He took a sip, relishing the
first hit of the dawn. It was dark and sweet, the real thing despite the
container.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, please . . . at least hear me out.&quot; He
reached for a cigarette, extracting it filter-first from his trench coat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have a serious personal problem, and I don't know
where else to turn.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Could it be true? Vance examined him more closely. The beard
wasn't the only change. The left side of his gray coat bulged as he searched
for his lighter. Alex had never bothered to carry his own protection. At least
never before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He knew Alex Novosty was part of KGB's </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>T-Directorate</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, </span><span style='font-size:

color:windowtext'>’s special organization for high-tech theft. In the old days
he operated out of Sophia, arranging the laundering of underground Soviet funds
by mingling them with the flight capital and drug money that made its way between
Turkey's Ziraat Bank, the Vatican's Istituto per le Opere di Religione, and
Geneva no-questions fronts with names like the Banco di Roma per la Svizzera.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The truth was, Michael Vance, Jr., and Aleksei Ilyich Novosty
had, over the years, often traveled the same paths. They used the same
organizations and contacts—Novosty to conceal illicit monies, Vance to expose
them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, I always enjoyed our games.&quot; Novosty
looked out over </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Athens</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, his voice trailing off. &quot;But,
as you say, that was the old days. The world's changed. Now perhaps we can just
be two professionals. Do some business.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He seated himself on a block of marble, still
slightly moist with morning dew, and withdrew a wrinkled clipping. It was from
The Times of London. &quot;Here, read this, please.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

it on the Reuters satellite news service. He had looked it over, stored it in
his news-update computer file, and promptly forgotten about it.</span></p>

you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My friend, this thing is no game.&quot; Novosty
crumpled his cup. In his other hand, the cigarette remained unlit. &quot;I was
. . . involved. Of course, I didn't know then. But if </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance stared into his dark eyes, trying to gauge the truth.
None of it added up. &quot;Alex, you're one of the sharpest guys in the

even get close to it? The thing had to be some internal play.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

shower. &quot;Perhaps I . . . yes, it was an unknown, but what is life without
unknowns? The job looked simple, Michael. I just had to launder it. Easy
enough. Of course, if I had realized . . .&quot; Again his voice trailed into
the morning haze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what's the inside story?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Novosty drew once more on his cigarette. Finally he spoke.
&quot;All right. The number of twenty million rubles? Of course it's 'disinformation.'
Typical. The real amount, naturally, is classified. There is even a formal
directive, signed by Chief, First Directorate Gribanov.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Guess KGB still has enough clout to write the
rules.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The old ways die hard. They, and the military, are
fighting a rearguard action to protect their turf—just as your CIA and the U.S.
Department of Defense are doing now. Which is why they are so concerned about
this. If they don't get to the bottom of it, they will once again be proved
incompetent . .  . as well as over-funded.&quot; He scratched at his beard.
&quot;More to the point, this operation went around them. That's a very bad
precedent, if you understand what I'm saying. And the money, Michael, was
almost three times what they admitted. In dollars it was over a hundred
million.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nice chunk of change.&quot; Vance whistled quietly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Even now, though, I have to admit it was brilliant.
Flawless. Viktor Fedorovich Volodin, first secretary of the State Committee for
Sakhalin, Far Eastern District, got authority signed off, got his passport
stamped vyezdnye, or suitable for travel, and then wired the sixty million
rubles not to the district, but to the state bank of Poland, with instructions
for conversion. A lot of money, yes, but it was not unprecedented. And he did it
late Friday, around two in the afternoon, after all the <i>nomenklatura</i> had
left for their weekend <i>dachas</i>. By Monday morning he was in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Warsaw</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, to clarify the 'mistake.' Next the
money was sent to my old bank connection in Sophia . . . by then, of course, it's
<i>zlotis .</i> . . I just assumed it was something KGB wanted laundered.&quot;
He paused. &quot;They claim sometimes things have to be handled outside the <i>nomenklatura</i>,
to avoid the paperwork bottleneck.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All of it,&quot; he sighed. &quot;I converted it to
deutsche marks, then bought pounds sterling and used those to acquire British
gilts, the long-term government bonds. They're currently parked in a dummy
account at Moscow Narodny Bank, in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

The momentary lilt drained from his voice. &quot;But now, now what can I do?
The funds are just sitting there, waiting. But if I show up and try to wire
them out, I'm probably as good as dead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>London</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, I may not have a life. I think KGB
already suspects I was somehow connected. If they find me, they will turn me
into sausages. I'm trapped. You've got to help me move it again, make the trail
just disappear.&quot; He tossed away his cigarette and immediately reached into
his overcoat for another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Seems to me the first thing you ought to do is try and
locate Comrade Volodin. Maybe let a couple of your boys have a small
heart-to-heart with him. Little socialist realism. Give him some incentive to
straighten it out himself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, first directorate is already combing the
toilets of the world for him. He's vanished. The ministry of defense, and the
GRU—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The military secret service.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Exactly. The minute either of them finds him, the man's
a corpse.&quot; He shrugged, eyes narrowing. &quot;If I don't find him
first.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance listened, wondering. &quot;That's a very touching
story. You could almost set it to music. Only trouble is, the punch line's
missing. There's got to be more—too much money's involved. So who else is in on
this? </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>South Africa</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>? </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Angola</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean? I've told you everything I know.
Volodin, the bastard, used me as part of his swindle. But now he's lost his
nerve and run, disappeared, and left me to face—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sure, that's all there is to it.&quot; He cut in,
laughing. &quot;Incidentally, you take your standard cut up front? Back at the
beginning?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, please, I am a businessman. Of course. The
usual percentage. But now—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Like you say, it's a problem.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned to stub out his cigarette. &quot;A nightmare. Think
about it. A hundred million dollars </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>U.S.</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
That's starting to be real money, even for the </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>USSR</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
Not even the czars ever managed to steal so much.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance looked him over. Novosty was telling the story
backward, inside out. &quot;Look, whenever somebody gives me only half a setup,
I just—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, no one knows better than you all the ways
money can be moved in this world. Those funds must be made to just vanish from </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>London</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, then reappear anothe</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r place</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> with no trail. I have already
arranged for a bank, far away. After that the money can be returned, anonymously.
What other solution is there?&quot; He hesitated painfully. &quot;You know, I
have no friends I have not bought—the definition of a tragic life. But I
remember you always were a man who kept his word. I can trust you. Besides,
where else can I turn?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alex, forget it. I've already got all the fun I can
handle.&quot; Vance sipped his coffee, now down to the black grounds and
undissolved sugar. It was both bitter and sweet, contradictory sensations
against his tongue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just like Novosty's tale, part truth and part lie. Alex had
no intention of returning the money, for chrisake. He was probably in the scam <i>with</i>
Volodin. And now the hounds were baying. The main problem was, who were the
hounds?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, do us both a favor. Help me move it.&quot; He
pressed. &quot;I'll take care of the rest. And I'll even give you half the two
million that was my commission. Just take it. Gold. Tax free. It's yours.
You'll be set for life. All you have to do is arrange to transfer the money to
another bank I will tell you. I have an account already waiting, everything,
but I can't do it myself. They're too close to me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A million dollars, he thought. Christ, with that you could
pay off the four hundred thousand mortgage on the boats, free and clear. You'd
also be helping Alex out of a jam, and the man looked like he could use all the
help he could get. He stared out toward the encircling mountains, now swathed
in fleecy clouds. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No. The deal had too many unknowns. The whole point</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>of working
for yourself was you could pick and choose your jobs. If you ever started going
with the highest bidder, you were a fool. Guys who did that didn't last in this
business.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Afraid I'll have to pass. There're plenty of other . .
.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when he absently glanced down at the early sun
glinting off the windows of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Athens</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. In the parking lot below, a tan,
late-model Audi had just pulled in. He watched as it idled.
&quot;Incidentally,&quot; he said as he thumbed at the car, &quot;friends of
yours? More art lovers?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Novosty took one look and stopped cold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, I'm sorry, I really must be going. But . . .
perhaps you might wish to stay here for a few more minutes. Enjoy the women. .
. . Though I hear you like them better in the flesh. . . .&quot; He reached
into his breast pocket. &quot;Think about what I've said. And in the meantime,
you should have this.&quot; He handed over a gray envelope. &quot;It's the
original authorization I received from Volodin . . . when he transferred the
funds to the bank in Sophia.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, I'm not—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Please, just take it. Incidentally, it probably means
nothing, but there's a corporate name there. I originally assumed it was KGB's
cover. Who knows. . . .&quot; He continued to urge the envelope into Vance's
hand. &quot;I've written the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>London</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> information you will need on the
back. The account at Narodny, everything.&quot; He was turning. &quot;Be
reasonable, my friend. We can help each other, maybe more than you
realize.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hold on.&quot; Vance was opening the envelope. Then he
lifted out a folded page, blue. &quot;Good name for a dummy front. Nice mythic
ring.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What . . .?&quot; Novosty glanced back. &quot;Ah, yes.
From the old story.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Daedalus.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, everything about this is a fiction. I realize that
now. Of course The Daedalus Corporation does not exist.&quot; He paused.
&quot;Like you say, it's just a myth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance was examining the sheet, an ice blue reflecting the
early light. Almost luminous. Something about it was very strange. Then he
massaged it with his fingertips.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It wasn't paper. Instead it was some sort of synthetic
composition, smooth like silicon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Saying nothing, he turned away and extracted a booklet of
hotel matches. He struck one, cupped it against the light wind, and with a
quick motion touched the flame to the lower corner of the sheet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The fire made no mark. So his hunch was right. The
&quot;paper&quot; was heat resistant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When he held it up, to examine it against the early sun, he
noticed there was a &quot;watermark,&quot; ever so faint, an opaque symbol that
covered the entire page. It was so large he hadn't seen it at first; it could
have been reflections in the paper. He stared a second before he recognized—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Talk to me.&quot; He whirled around. &quot;The truth,
for a change. Do you know where I'm headed this afternoon?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I confess my people did obtain your itinerary, Michael.
But only in order to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Only yesterday.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That was after you got your hands on this, right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course. I just told you. That was the original
authorization.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Daedalus Corporation?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That name is only a myth. Nothing but paper.&quot; He
began walking briskly down the steps next to the </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Temple</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'> of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Athena
  Nike</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Sacred Way</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, toward his black limousine in the
parking lot. &quot;We will finish this later. The final arrangements. I will be
in touch.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance watched as the black limo backed around and quickly
headed toward the avenue. After a few moments, the tan Audi slowly pulled out
of the parking lot to follow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned back to look at the temples, sorting through the
story. Somebody in this world, this Daedalus Corporation or whomever it
represented, had a hundred million dollars coming, dollars now all nicely laundered
and ready to go. What did it add up to?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In years past Alex Novosty had moved money with total
impunity. So why would he turn up in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Athens</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
bearing an elaborate and patently bogus story, begging for help? It couldn't be
for the boys back at </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Dzerzhinsky
  Square</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Moscow</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. They never went outside with their
own problems. Besides, they cleaned money all the time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Somebody, somewhere, was pulling a fast one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Don't touch it, he told himself. For once in your life just
walk away. It's got to be hot. Bad news all around. Just forget it and go on to
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Crete</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He could hardly wait. Eva Borodin was meeting him there; a
decade-late reunion after all the stormy water under the bridge. Or was it
going to be a rematch? Whichever, that was going to be a scene. He had vague
hopes they might put together a rerun of years past, only this time with a
happy ending.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Still mulling over the pieces of Novosty's puzzle, he turned
and headed for the northwest edge of the Acropolis. In the distance stood the
ring of mountains that once served as </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Athens</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s
natural fortress: Parnes, mantled in dark forests of fir; the marble face of
Pentelikon; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Hymettus</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, legendary haunt of the honeybee;
Aigaleos, its noble twin crests rising up to greet the early sun. And directly
below lay the excavated ruins of the ancient Agora, the city center where
Socrates once misled the youth of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Greece</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
teaching them to think.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Vance needed to think. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Remembering it all later, he realized he'd been in precisely
the wrong place to actually witness the accident. He just heard it—the screech
of rubber, the sickening crunch of metal. He'd raced to look, but the
intersection below was already a carpet of flame.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What had happened? There was a gasoline truck, short and
bulky, wheels spinning in the air, its hood crumpled against the remains of an
automobile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He strained to see. Which was it? Alex's limo? The tan Audi?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then came the explosion, blotting out everything, an immense
orange ball that seemed to roll upward into the morning sky like an emerging
sun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Viktor Fedorovich Volodin was amazed he'd managed to make his
way this far, from the fiery intersection at the base of the Acropolis all the
way down Leoforos Amalias, without his frayed facade of calm completely
disintegrating. He bit his lip, using the pain to hold back the panic. Traffic
on the avenue was backed up as far as he could see, and firemen were still
trying to reach the charred remains of the truck. On his right, the new Zapio
conference center and its geometric gardens were shrouded in smoke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He scarcely noticed. Breathing was impossible anyway, since
the diesel fumes of the bus settled in through its broken windows and drove out
all oxygen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How had it come to this? He'd spent his entire life in the
party apparatus of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Sakhalin</span><span

plans concocted in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Moscow</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, trying to survive the infighting
and intrigue of the oblast's State Committee. Then one day a personal aide of
none other than the president, Mikhail Sergeevich himself, had secretly made an
offer that sounded too good to be true. Help transfer some funds, do it for the
Motherland. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It would be simple. KGB would never know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nobody told him he'd be stepping into a nightmare. And now
his worst fears had come true. To see your driver crushed alive, only inches
away, then watch him incinerated. They were closing in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

Everything is gone now, like a fairy tale.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He crouched down in the torn plastic seat as the
ancient city bus bumped and coughed its way into the center of Syntagma Square.
Around him were packed the usual morning commuters gripping briefcases and
lunch bags, cursing the delays and blaming the incompetents in Parliament. The
air was rank with sweat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally the vehicle shuddered to a halt. End of the line. He
rose, trembling, and worked his way to the forward exit, then dropped off. As
his feet touched down on the warm pavement, he quickly glanced right and left,
searching the crowded midmorning street for any telltale signs that he'd been
followed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was nobody, he concluded with relief. The milling
Greeks didn't seem to notice he was there, or care. They were too busy
complaining about the traffic, the smog, the latest round of inflation.
Business as usual in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Athens</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, the timeless city. This place, he
told himself, should have been the perfect location to hide, to just disappear.
Novosty was supposed to handle the final delivery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe the crash had been an accident. Fate. <i>Sud'ba</i>.
Things happened that way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was sweating heavily now, whether from fear or the early
morning sun he wasn't sure. Already it was a nascent ball of fire in the east,
promising to bake the asphalt of the square by </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>noon</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stepped over the curb and onto the sidewalk. The outdoor
cafes were all thronged with workers and tourists having a quick coffee before
taking on the city this spring day. He felt his knees tremble slightly and
realized he only wanted to collapse. Any table would do. Just melt into the
crowd, he told himself, then nothing can happen. <i>Nichevo nye sluchitsya</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He wiped at his brow and settled nervously into the
first empty chair, plastic and dirty, hoping to look like just another tourist.
The cafe, he noted, was Papaspyrou, in front of the American Express office.
Perfect. Above all else, he wanted to pass for an American. But he was still
trying to get it right. How did they look?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

seizing the side of the table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

did look American!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was an accident, he kept telling himself. The truck
couldn't have—Relax. Novosty made the arrangement with the American, didn't he?
You saw him hand over the letter. Now the trail will just vanish. KGB will
never be able to stop it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned, casually flashed an empty smile for the small,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>gray-haired
waiter standing behind him, tray in hand, white towel over the sleeve of his
tailored but frayed brown suit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sure, thanks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>You're better every day, he told himself. You're even
starting to get the accent right now. Keep working on it. The twang. And learn
to saunter. The shoulders. Americans walk looser, swing their arms, seem not to
have a care in the world. Learn to slouch. Act like you own the world, even if
you no longer do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd been secretly practicing for weeks, getting ready to
disappear after his part was over. Of course, he'd originally planned to go
back home afterward. But that was before he had a taste of this. The good life,
the freedom. For that matter, maybe he'd go to </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. Why not? He'd heard how it worked. Defection, so the
stories went, could be very rewarding. They'd open the golden gates for him at </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The tiny cup of murky black coffee appeared in front of him,
together with the usual glass of tepid water. He reached for the water eagerly
and drank it down. Something, anything, to moisten the cotton in his mouth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There, that was better. Now the hard part: something to quiet
his mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The cup rattled against the saucer as he gingerly picked it
up. He could still see the cab of the truck coming out of nowhere, hurtling
down on them, still feel the horror. Odd, but he couldn't remember anyone at
the wheel. He wanted a face, but none was there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His own driver, the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Afghanistan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
veteran Grigor Yanovich, had tried to swerve, but he hadn't been quick enough.
He'd caught the first impact, the grind of metal that whipped the tan Audi
around, flung open the door . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Grigor, thirty years old, must have died without ever knowing
what happened, if not from the impact, then from the wall of flaming gasoline
that swept over the seat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He marveled at his own luck, the hand of chance that flung
him from the car only a second ahead of the explosion. He remembered skidding
across the pavement on his back, then tumbling into the grassy ditch that
separated </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Amalias Avenue</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> from the tiny side road of
Thrassilou. Some of the raw gasoline had drenched his sleeve, but he'd been
safely out of the way, his face down, when the explosion came.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It could have been an accident. He swiped at his brow and
told himself that anything was possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Don't be a fool. They're closing in. How much do they know?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He sipped at the gritty coffee and scanned the street.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just get through the next few days, he told himself. Once the
transfer's complete, your part's over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was reaching for his small white cup when he noticed the
woman, striding directly toward his table, smiling, catching his eye. The way
she was swinging her brown leather purse, the jaunty thrust of hips beneath the
suede skirt, the carefully groomed auburn hair—all marked her as American. Rich
American. Probably headed into American Express to cash a thousand or so in
traveler's checks. </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He lounged back in his chair with a rakish air. He was, he
knew, an attractive man. He had deep blue eyes, sandy hair, a practiced smile,
a trim figure far younger than his fifty-six years. He'd divorced his wife
Natasha three years ago, after she discovered his lunchtime liaisons with one
of the girls in the State Committee typing pool. He had experience handling
women.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Three weeks in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

he thought, and maybe my luck is about to change. If you can get her, the
nightmare could be over for a while. You can't go back to the hotel now; they
may be watching. But if she's got a room somewhere? What better way to hide out
till the transfer is complete?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was still trying to make his ragged mind function. Now was
the time for a &quot;pick-up&quot; routine. The lonely traveler . . . <i>Kak
grussno mnye, tak zhalostno mnye </i>. . . no, damn, not the sentimental
Russian, think American.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But where? He'd heard of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>New York</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>San Francisco</span><span

  color:windowtext'>Miami</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
even Chicago. But what if she was from one of those places?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All the careful preparation and he still didn't dare put
himself to the test. So what would he say? </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Canada</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>?
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Australia</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her eyes held his, interest growing as she continued to
approach. They were darkened with kohl, sensual, inviting. And she was still
smiling, even as she placed her hand on the chair across from him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was this how the women . . .? </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> was the Promised Land.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Etot stolnik osvobodetsya</i>, Viktor
Fedorovich?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It took a second for the language to register. She
was speaking Russian, calmly inquiring if the table was free, but his mind was
rejecting it, refusing to accept the implications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps you'd like to buy me a <i>kofye</i>, Comrade. I
prefer it very sweet.&quot; Now she was settling her purse on the table,
adjusting her tight skirt in preparation to sit. &quot;Or would you rather take
me shopping. I could help you spend some of the money.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd never seen her before in his life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Your part will be routine. Somewhere in the back of his mind
echoed the voice of the president's personal aide, the brisk young Muscovite
who had come to his dacha that snowy evening last October. We will take care of
any risks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It had all been a lie. Every word. They must have known where
he was every minute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he spotted the two men approaching from opposite sides
of the square. The suits that didn't quite fit, the trudging gait. Why must
they always look like the stupid, brutal party hacks they are, he thought
bitterly. The incompetent bastards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Who betrayed me? Was it Novosty? Did he do this, to get them
off his trail?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So be it. First I'll kill her, and then I kill him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Seething, he pulled his body erect while his right hand
plunged for the snap on the holster at his belt. Simple. He'd just shoot her on
the spot, then make a run for it. Through the cafe, out the back. They wouldn't
dare start anything here, in the middle of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Athens</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
that would cause an international &quot;incident.&quot; The snap was open. He
thumbed up the leather flap and realized the holster was empty. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The crash. It must have jarred loose. His new Walther
automatic had been incinerated, along with the Audi. His life began to flash
before his eyes. Make a run for it, he heard his mind saying, commandeer the
first taxi, any taxi. He shoved back from the table, sending his chair
clattering across the patched sidewalk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>She reached into her leather purse, now lying atop
the table, next to his coffee. He heard the click of a safety sliding off.
&quot;Don't be impetuous, Viktor Fedorovich. You've been such a good boy this
last week, showing us the sights. The perfect tour guide. But now your little
vacation is over. We must talk.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;About what?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She smiled. &quot;Whatever you think we need to hear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know anything.&quot; He could feel the cold
sweat on his palms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Viktor Fedorovich.&quot; She brushed at her auburn hair
as she continued in Russian. &quot;You have the most valuable commodity in the
world, knowledge. That makes you even richer than you think you are now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They didn't try to kill me this morning, he suddenly
realized. It was Alex they were— Is he planning to double- cross everybody? No,
that's insane. He'd never get away with it. He has to deliver the payment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>KGB wants me alive, he thought with a wave of relief. They
think I'm the one who knows where it is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His pulse raced. &quot;What do you want?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We need you to answer certain questions. But not here.
At a place where it's quieter.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The two men were loitering closer now, only a few feet away,
one on each side of the table. The first was overweight, with bushy eyebrows
and pockmarked cheeks. He could be Ukrainian. The other was medium height, wearing
a cheap polyester suit, balding and sallow. Neither looked as though he had
smiled in the last decade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where do you want to go?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We will take a stroll in the park.&quot; She gestured
toward </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Amalias Avenue</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. On the other side was Ethnikos
Kipos, the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>National</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Garden</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
Then she smiled again. &quot;We thought you would like to take the morning
air.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She rose, purse in hand, and tossed a wad of drachmas onto
the wooden table. The coffee drinkers around them did not look up from their
newspapers and tourist maps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they made their way past the Olympic Airways office on the
corner and across the avenue, she said nothing. Her silence is deliberate, he
told himself, part of a trick to unnerve me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was working. He was learning something about himself he'd
never before known. He was learning he was a coward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was the reality. He wouldn't hold out. He'd tell them
everything he knew, because they would hurt him badly. He couldn't bear pain;
they probably knew that. And then they'd kill him anyway because he couldn't
tell them the one thing they wanted to know. He didn't know it himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Viktor Fedorovich Volodin realized he was about to die. All
the years of pointless intrigue in the party, the fudging of production
figures, the father-in-law who'd made his existence wretched, it all added up
to a lifetime of nothing but misery, with the payoff a bullet. Rasstrel, a KGB
execution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They were entering the national garden, a mirage of green in
the desert of asphalt and cement that is central </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Athens</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. Its informal walkways were shady lanes of quiet and cool
that seemed miles away from the smoke and glare and heat of the avenues.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally she spoke. &quot;We're running out of time, and patience,
Viktor Fedorovich. Let's start with the money. Where have you deposited it?
Next, we want to know the names of everyone—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It—it's—I don't know where it is now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're lying.&quot; She did not break her pace.
&quot;The time for that is over.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But I don't have it. Someone else—&quot; He heard
himself blurting out the truth. &quot;He's in charge of everything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You are lying, again. You are the one who embezzled the
funds.&quot; She was walking by his side as they entered a secluded alleyway of
hedges, the other two trailed only inches behind. There was no escape.
&quot;The criminal is you, Viktor Fedorovich.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, he—I—I don't know anything.&quot; How true was
that? he asked himself. He knew where the money was supposed to go, but he
didn't know what it was for, at least not specifically. That part had been
classified. He had the small picture but not the big one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you know nothing, then telling us everything you do
know should not take very long.&quot; The calm, the assurance in her voice sent
chills through him. He knew he would talk and they knew it too. &quot;However,
the more you have to say, the longer we can linger.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The early morning park, with its manicured footpaths and
wandering cats, was empty except for a few gardeners trimming hedges, watering
the grass, collecting loose papers. The sounds of the avenue were rapidly
receding. Now the two men had moved directly alongside, one by each arm. He
realized they were both taller than he was, and they smelled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Wait. I don't know where it's deposited now; I wasn't
supposed to know. But there's still time. I can help—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They were entering a long arbor, a high trellis bright with
obscuring red flowers, when the first blow came into his left side, directly in
his kidney. He groaned and sagged, breath gone, while the man on the right
slipped an arm around and held him erect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, Viktor Fedorovich,&quot; the woman continued
tonelessly, &quot;you will help us, because you will want to die long before we
let you. So, shall we try again? Where is the money?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's . . . I don't know, exactly. But—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He gasped and sagged again as another blow came. Already he
wasn't sure how much more pain he could tolerate. How long before he would just
blurt out everything he knew?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A third blow, and his knees crumpled. He had never known the
meaning of pain, or fear, until this moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why not just tell them? his frightened mind was pleading.
Alex has already set it up with the American.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You are worse than a mere criminal,&quot; she went on,
dark eyes filling with anger. &quot;You are a traitor. You will tell us every
detail of your involvement, from the very beginning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How much did they really know? he wondered. Were they
bluffing?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They were bluffing, he quickly concluded. Otherwise she
wouldn't be asking him things she should already know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If you talk, you'll jeopardize everything. The most important
thing now is to keep KGB from discovering the scenario. If they do, they still
could stop it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Of course they were alarmed. They should be. In the New
Russia being born, there was no place for them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But I can't endure pain. I'll talk if there's pain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He felt a surge of resolve. Whatever else happens, he told
himself, I won't be the one responsible for making it fail. I can't let them
know any more than they do now. I've—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Another blow struck him in the side and he felt his knees
turn to butter. None of the gardeners in the park seemed aware that a man was
about to be beaten to death. To them the four foreigners were merely huddled
together as they strolled, enjoying the dubious beauty of modern </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Athens</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Another blow came and he wheezed. &quot;Please, let me
just—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd been gathering his strength for this moment. Now he
lunged forward, shutting out the stab of pain in his side, and wrenched at her
open purse. The two men reached for him but not before he had it in his grasp.
His hand plunged in as he rolled to the ground.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They were on top of him now, shoving his face against the
loose pebbles of the walkway, but they were too late. He felt the smooth metal
of the grip. It was what he wanted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, you look marvelous. It's so good to see you
again. I really mean that. The years have treated you well.&quot; Eva Borodin
leaned back against the gray fabric of the Saab's headrest and appraised him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You don't look half bad yourself.&quot; Vance smiled to
himself as he returned the favor. Vintage Eva, ladling on the flattery. But she
was smashing, just as he remembered—the coal-black hair, the smoldering eyes,
the high Slavic cheekbones. Then, too, her every gesture was spiked with the
promise of Olympic sensuality; he remembered that as well. Everything about her
spoke of a time and place far away, where there were no rules. Eva, the eternal
Eva. With a Ph.D. &quot;Everything's just the same.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That part wasn't entirely true. There had been some changes,
probably for the better. Instead of a plunging neckline and a fortune in gold
accessories, she was wearing a blue silk blouse, form-fitting designer jeans
with an eighty-dollar scarf for a belt, and lambskin boots. Far more demure
than the old Eva. What had happened to the dangling turquoise earrings, enough
musky perfume to obscure radar, at least one endangered fur draped somewhere?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The years had definitely mellowed her. The Slavic passion
seemed curbed today, the same way her hair had been trimmed down to a pageboy.
Maybe, he thought, this was her new look: the Russian aristocrat of the
nineties.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, Michael, I'm different now. Or I'm trying to
be.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>She laughed,
flashed her come-on smile, and tried to toss her missing hair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whoops, he thought. Sure, you've changed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Being formally promoted to director of SIGINT brings
responsibilities,&quot; she continued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Congratulations.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It was two years ago.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, congratulations anyway.&quot; He was beginning to
wonder if she really had mellowed. Back in the old days her Russianness was her
way of making a statement. An identity. How much could she change, want to
change? She'd always been a firebrand: throwing things was her preferred mode
of communication. Not to suggest she wasn't verbal: she was always passionately
happy to see him, passionately sad when bad things happened, passionately angry
when she didn't get her way. Everything she said was flirtatious, carrying a
sexual innuendo. Sometimes he thought she made Jean Harlow sound like Jeane
Kirkpatrick.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your call caught me a little off guard.&quot; He
glanced over. &quot;I never expected to hear from you again after you disappeared
into the labyrinth of NSA.&quot; He knew she'd been with the National Security
Agency for eight years now, but he hadn't heard that she'd been promoted to
director of Soviet satellite intercepts. Of course, NSA didn't spend a lot of
money on press releases. Still it was no surprise. Eva knew her stuff when it
came to the Soviets, their satellites, their codes. &quot;I must say, though,
this is a hell of a long way to come for a catch-up chat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's been way too many years since we've seen each
other. I've missed you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hope you mean that.&quot; Did she? he wondered. Even if
she did, that wasn't the real reason she'd come. He knew her too well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Guess you'll have to try and find out,&quot; she said,
her voice holding an instinctive, automatic invitation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Guess I will.&quot; Already it felt like the old days.
How did she know so precisely where all his buttons were? The only thing I'm
sure of so far today is that this morning's little accident was no
accident.&quot; He'd told her about seeing Novosty, but not what they'd talked
about. Why drag her into it? Besides, she'd known about Alex a lot longer than
he had. Just one more piece of the past that didn't need to be stirred up.
&quot;Somebody got taken out. The question is, Who? We both know Novosty's a
survivor, old school, but . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I probably shouldn't say this, Michael, but I assume
you're aware he's KGB, part of T-Directorate.&quot; Her voice had grown
serious. &quot;That executive VP slot he has with Techmashimport is just his
cover. We've had a file of intercepts on him for years.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course I know about him. Good old Alex and I go back
a while. You're slightly out of date concerning my most recent fun and
games.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right. I mean, I wouldn't even bring it up, but I
think you should be warned. KGB's in a big turmoil, looking for something . .
.&quot; She paused. &quot;Whenever this happens, there're plenty of stray
arrows sure to be flying. Just stay out of the crossfire. A word to the
wise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I may already be in it. Thanks to Novosty's little 'welcome
aboard' breakfast.&quot; He remembered the letter Alex had given him. &quot;But
I'm beginning to think I'd damn well better find out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked around sharply. &quot;What happened? Did he say
something?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you believe him, somebody in Moscow mislaid a few
million dollars. Darndest thing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's better left alone, darling.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm on vacation, remember?&quot; He winked at her.
&quot;With better things to do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I should hope so.&quot; She leaned back again and
studied his profile. &quot;Well, at long last it's happened. I finally have to
admit I need you for something.&quot; Her long, dark lashes fluttered. Warming
me up, he thought. Now we're getting down to business. &quot;Which is why I
wanted to meet you here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They were five minutes out of Iraklion, on an unpaved back
road he loved, headed for the palace at Knossos, and so far she'd done nothing
but hint about what was on her mind. Everything was still a puzzle. For one
thing, she never needed anybody. She was the stalwart Russian who'd ended their
affair eleven years earlier just as casually as she had begun it. This
afternoon, though, she seemed to be deliberately keeping the lid on, holding
back. Uncharacteristic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The truth is,&quot; she went on, &quot;I've been
thinking about us, the old times, and the palace.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She'd called him in Nassau four days earlier, wanting to get
together. It was the old Eva, darling this and darling that. When he said he
was going to Crete, she'd grown strangely silent. Then she'd said—in a curious,
tiny, voice—&quot;Why don't I just meet you there? In fact, that's sort of why
I rang. . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So why's the palace suddenly so important to you?&quot;
He examined her, still trying to read her mood. &quot;I need to go back out
today. Try and brush up a bit. But that place was part of our problem back
when, not part of the solution.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She didn't answer. Instead she shifted the conversation
sideways. &quot;Speaking of the palace, I suppose I should congratulate you on
finally being proved right. Did the Stuttgart team really ask you to look in on
their dig?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Call it the ultimate capitulation,&quot; he grinned.
&quot;Remember, they were the ones who led the critical fusillade when the book
first came out. That makes it doubly sweet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right. I also remember that book of yours caused such a
stink that no serious university would consider hiring you. Which, I assume, is
why you ended up a part-time spook. Probably it was the only job you could
get.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're closer to the truth than you know.&quot; He
laughed, wondering for the ten-thousandth time if he should have stuck out the
academic slings and arrows. No, the secret truth was he was bored with the
university regimen. He yearned for the real world. He knew it then and he knew
it now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then the next thing I heard, you were down in the
Bahamas, goofing off and renovating some old yacht.&quot; She looked him over
once more, shaking her head. &quot;What did you end up christening it? The Fuck
Everybody?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Crossed my mind. But then I chickened out and called
her the <i>Ulysses</i>.&quot; He leaned back and reflected momentarily on the
forty-four-foot Bristol racing sloop he'd restored, having picked it up for a
song at a customs-house sale on Bay Street. Formerly the possession of a
Colombian in the export business, it had a hull of one and three-quarter inch
planked cedar, with a trim beam, did an easy fifteen knots in a decent breeze.
He loved her. He'd installed a fortune in electronics, including a Micrologic
Commander LORAN and a Navstar satellite navigation system. &quot;It started out
as a hobby, and three boats and a mortgage later it ended up a business.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what do you do down there all day? Just sit around
and drink margaritas?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sure. About once a month.&quot; He reached up and adjusted
the open top of the car. &quot;Hate to admit it, but on a typical day I'm
usually out of bed by sunrise. Check the weather, then maybe take a short swim
to get the oxygen flowing. After that I go to work. The 'office' is up forward
in the <i>Ulysses</i>. My main discovery is that chartering is pretty much like
any other business. Mostly problems.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was. There were always tourists who came to Nassau
thinking they wanted more than the standard hotels, topless shows, and casinos
on Paradise Island and Cable Beach. They wanted a taste of what it was like
sailing through the Family Islands, away from the glitz, a feeling for the real
Caribbean. Or so they thought. That was until they discovered the hard way that
the real thing included broiling sun, jellyfish stings, nosy sharks, hangovers,
seasickness, close-quarters quarrels with spouses and significant others,
snapped fishing lines, generator failures, unexpected weather . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And you manage to do okay, right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nobody ever got rich in the charter business, at least
the kind I'm in. If you're not running high-priced South American produce, you
have to do it for love, not money.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His real livelihood, which he didn't bother to mention, came
from elsewhere. In between managing Bahamian skippers and crews he also kept a
hand in another occupation. In years past he'd served as a financial consultant
for the CIA, helping monitor the flow of illicit drug and terrorist money
passing through the banking laundries of Geneva and the Caribbean. When the
Company finally formed its own section to handle that work, he'd moved on and
hired out his expertise to a free-lance organization called ARM, the
Association of Retired Mercenaries. They were retired, all right, but only from
the antiterrorist units of a half dozen European nations. They still saw plenty
of covert action, squelching those terrorist activities European governments
wanted dealt with outside official channels. He was their money man and they
paid him well, which was how he kept his three vessels shipshape and lived a
yachtsman's life of &quot;ease.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So after all these years, you ended up doing exactly
what you wanted.&quot; She looked at him admiringly. &quot;A lot of people
would probably envy you that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I like taking my own risks, if that's what you
mean.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, all the same I suspect you're secretly very
pleased with the fact you've been invited back to Crete. I always thought you'd
return to archaeology sooner or later. If I know you, you couldn't stay away
forever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was she right? Even now he didn't know. &quot;One thing's for
sure. Crete's a world apart.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was an understatement. As he glanced back at the road,
it was now blocked entirely by a herd of sheep, their shaggy brown fleeces
suspended above dark, spindly legs. Around them the silence of the Cretan
countryside was rent by bleats and the jangle of bells. The flock milled and
darted about their rented Saab, but failed to move on down the road. Why
bother? The shepherd, in dark hat and coat, lounged sidesaddle on his burro,
oblivious, while his black-shawled wife trudged in his dusty wake, bringing up
the rear. Strangers came, gazed upon the wonders of his land, then departed;
he, possessor of donkey, sheep, and wife, would remain. And prevail. His
weathered face contained all the worthwhile knowledge in the world. The parched
hills and verdant valleys of Crete belonged to him alone. Now and forever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay,&quot; he went on, &quot;you're here, I'm here.
Now how about telling me what's going on?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's just it. I don't know for sure. Everybody at NSA
claims I'm starting to see things.&quot; She paused to examine a long red
fingernail. &quot;So don't you say it too. I need some moral support.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe I'd better hear this first.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, I . . . I don't want to talk about it yet.
It's just—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, give me a hint at least.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A few days back I decoded part of a transmission . .
.&quot; She leaned over and started to turn on the radio, then changed her mind
and straightened. &quot;Look, I just need you to help me get my thoughts
organized.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is that why you came all the way here? To organize your
thoughts? You'll forgive me if I'd hoped for a little more.&quot; In spite of
himself, he felt mildly annoyed. The truth was, he'd been looking forward to a
reunion that wasn't about business. &quot;You know, I sort of had the idea you
wanted to . . . well, maybe try and piece things back together.&quot; He looked
her over. &quot;Being with you wasn't exactly the worst experience of my
life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She sighed wistfully and smoothed back her hair. &quot;Fixing
Humpty Dumpty is tough work, darling. We both know that. It's been a long time.
Life's never that simple.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe not for you. But it seems very simple to me. We
just lose the past. Pretend it never existed.&quot; He felt his pique growing.
&quot;Or then again, screw it. What are we doing here anyway?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Could it really work a second time around? he asked himself.
Why not? Through all those years after things fell apart, he'd never once
stopped remembering her. Her mind, her body, her excitement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Those memories dogged him now as they drove down the road he
knew so well, had traveled so many times in his long-ago life. At times the
ancient palace here on Crete had seemed almost a second home. After the
publication of his book about it, Realm of the Spirit—to universal denunciations—he
even began to dream about it. He thought he'd never come back, and now here he
was with Eva. Life took strange turns sometimes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Eleven years ago in New Haven when he'd decided to work for
himself, he'd actually been saying good-bye to this world and all it stood for.
Back then it had seemed a golden moment to give academia the bird.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Had it all come full circle now? Fortunately he'd kept up
with the journals when he had the chance, tried to stay on top of what was
happening. With any luck he'd have the pleasure of watching a lot of academics
eat crow. All he had to do was just deal with whatever was bugging Eva and then
get on down to Phaistos. He hoped the Stuttgart crew wouldn't realize he was
over a decade out of date.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know,&quot; she was searching in her purse, then
stopped herself and looked up, &quot;I always remember the palace when I think
of you. It sort of tied us together.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Best I remember, it's what finally drove us apart. It
turned into our 'irreconcilable difference.' &quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe you're right, and it was dumb of me. Given the
lousy luck I've had with men, you're probably the best thing that ever came
along. After that flap over your book, I let you get away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hold on a second. You announced you had to live your
own life, and I was getting too emotionally involved in my work and it would be
better all around if we just shook hands and called it quits. No hard
feelings.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It wasn't quite like that.&quot; She laughed her
alluring laugh, the one he remembered so well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, <i>no</i>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, maybe it was a little like that.&quot; Out came
the sunglasses. The old Eva again. &quot;But I was changing, Michael, more
every day. It was time to try and make it on my own.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was definitely what she'd decided to do. He'd always
thought she broke things off because she was obsessed with finishing her own
Ph.D. Self-centered and self-indulgent, that's what he'd called her at the time,
just another pampered Russian blue blood. Only years later did he realize how
self-centered he'd been. Maybe she'd been right; maybe they weren't ready for
each other yet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She sighed, and then her voice came as a whisper. &quot;You
know, after you called this morning and told me about that nightmare with Alex,
I just drank some retsina and went back to bed.&quot; She put on the shades,
adjusted them, and looked his way. He thought they went well with her new
forties hairstyle. &quot;Michael, I know things I shouldn't. And the things I
should know, I don't. The worse part of all is, none of it makes any
sense.&quot; Her eyes seemed to soften behind the tinted plastic. &quot;Do you
remember the first time you and I talked about this place?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Like it was yesterday.&quot; Who could forget? It was
just after Realm was published, relating his theory that the palace, whatever
it may have been originally, had eventually become a ceremonial necropolis, an
abode of the dead. &quot;We ended up having a terrific argument over the book.
Nobody wanted to believe me, including you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on, darling, it wasn't my opinion you cared about.
It was your father's. The revered holder of Penn's Edelstein Chair of Classical
Antiquities. Supposedly the world's living expert on Minoan Crete.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Did he really care what the old man thought? he wondered. Not
in the way she meant. He would have liked it, though, if everybody had gotten
along a little better. Michael Vance, Sr., never quite knew what to make of
Eva's Slavic intensity, since it contrasted so vividly with his own up-tight
Anglo-Saxon instincts. That was a repressive family strain Mike had
fought—successfully, he hoped—to undo all his life. Eva had looked to be the
perfect soul mate in that battle. She was born unrepressed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her own father, Count Serge Borodin, was president emeritus
of the Russian Nobility Association in America, exiled aristocracy. They were a
people apart. He recalled in particular a Russian Orthodox wedding they'd all
attended once. The operative assumption that sunny afternoon in Oyster Bay was
that the czar had been a living god, the Romanovs the world's last surviving
cherubim. He still remembered the black-hatted Orthodox prelates and the
incense and the tinny balalaikas and all the counts and countesses drunk and
dancing and crying at the same time. Growing up in the middle of that, she had
to be exuberant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'd gone off on your own and set the world of archaeology
on its ear,&quot; she continued. &quot;Typical Michael. But your father refused
to stick up for you when all the shit came down. I guess I didn't support you
very well either, I admit now. I'm truly sorry, darling, looking back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No big deal. I could handle it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sure.&quot; She reached over and patted his thigh.
&quot;You handled it just great. You were disgusted. At me, at him, at all the
'stuffed-shirt' academics who never went out on a dig and got their hands
dirty. You practically dragged me here to show me you were right. You were
obsessed with the palace, admit it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It wasn't that bad.&quot; He looked over at her.
&quot;Was it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let's not talk about it anymore, all right?&quot; She
sighed. &quot;Christ.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Fine with me.&quot; He was pulling off the main road,
heading into the flower-lined trail, the arcade of magenta bougainvillea that
led down toward the palace. &quot;By the way, I brought along some ouzo.&quot;
He indicated a pint bottle in his coat. &quot;What's a picnic without a little
rocket fuel?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You think of everything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I also think we should park up here, dodge the tour-bus
mayhem. Keep the funny hats and loudspeakers to a minimum.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, please. Besides, I could use the air.&quot; She
inhaled deeply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Around them the few lingering white sprays of almond blossoms
seemed like remnants of late spring snow, while the ground itself was blanketed
with wild orchids, lavender and pink anemones, white narcissus. He watched as
she climbed out of the car, then stopped to pluck a waxy yellow prickly pear
flower, next an orange-blue Iris <i>cretica</i>. He loved the flowers of Crete,
and the afternoon was fragrant with the scent of jasmine and lemon blossoms.
Ahead, down the hill, was the parking lot for the palace, with two tour busses
in attendance, one just pulling out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How long has it been since we were last here together?&quot;
She brushed her dark bangs back from her brow as she squinted into the waning
sun, sniffing at her cactus flower.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's beginning to seem like forever. But I think it's
about—what?—almost twelve years now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And how old is the palace supposed to be? I've gotten a
little rusty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The latest theory going is that it was destroyed about
fourteen hundred B.C. So we're talking roughly three and a half thousand years
since it was last used.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Guess our little decade doesn't count for much in the
grand scheme.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Time flies.&quot; He remembered how she'd been back
then, that day so long ago when she had been in her mid-twenties, as inviting
as the brazen ladies-in-waiting of the palace frescoes, and even more
voluptuous. <i>Mais, ce sont des Parisiennes</i>, a dazzled French scholar had
marveled. She was like that. Perfect sensuality. For a while he'd forgotten all
about archaeology and just concentrated on beauty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The place where all this occurred was the Palace of Knossos,
lovingly restored in the early part of the twentieth century by the wealthy
English archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans. There an almost modern civilization had
flowered to magnificent heights, then mysteriously vanished. The path leading
to the palace down the hill was becoming wider as they walked, opening on the
distant olive groves in the valley. The vista was stunning, probably the reason
it had been built here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked over and noticed she was digging in her purse
again. This time she drew out a pack of Dunhills. He watched while she flicked
a gold lighter, the one he'd given her as a present so long ago, emblazoned
with a lapis lazuli skull and crossbones. At the time, the hint had worked.
She'd quit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The return of the death wish? When did you start that
again?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Last week.&quot; She defiantly took a puff.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Any particular reason?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, darling, I just did it.&quot; She exhaled.
&quot;I'm wound up. I'm . . . I'm scared. Michael, for godsake, how many reasons
am I supposed to need?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, lighten up.&quot; He'd quit a month after they
met, but it hadn't been a big deal. &quot;I've mellowed out from the old days.
Life is like most other things—a lot more fun when you don't take it too
seriously.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They were moving across the empty parking lot, headed for the
entrance to the palace. It had once been a twelve-hundred-room labyrinth,
perhaps deliberately confusing. Now the upper courtyard and chambers lay
exposed to the sky, their massive red-and-ocher columns glistening in the
waning sunlight. The columns tapered downward, as though tree trunks had been
planted upside down to prevent resprouting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was a poetic place to meet Eva again, he thought. And
thoroughly bizarre as well. She'd gotten her Ph.D. in linguistics, specializing
in ancient Aegean languages, then a few months later she'd surprised everybody
by accepting a slot at the National Security Agency, that sprawling electronic
beehive of eavesdropping that lies midway between Washington and Baltimore, on
the thousand acres of Fort Meade. It'd seemed a startling about-face at the
time, but maybe it made sense. Besides, it was that or teaching.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>NSA was a midsized city, producing among other things forty
tons of classified paper trash a day. Its official insignia, appropriately, was
a fierce eagle clasping a key—whether to unlock the secrets of others or to
protect its own was unclear. Eva's particular branch, SIGINT—for signals intelligence—was
an operation so secret NSA refused even to admit it existed. Employing ten
acres of mainframe computers, Eva's SIGINT group monitored and analyzed every
Russian transmission anywhere: their satellite downlinks, the microwave
telephone networks within the Soviet Union, the chatter of civilian and
military pilots, missile telemetry far above the Pacific, the split-second
bursts of submarines reporting to base, even the limousine radiophone trysts
between Politburo members and their mistresses. The instant an electromagnetic
pulse left the earth, no matter its form or frequency, it belonged to the giant
electronic ears of the NSA.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So why shouldn't Eva end up as the agency's top Russian
codebreaker? She was a master at deciphering obscure texts, and she'd spoken
Russian all her life. Who better to make a career of cracking secret Soviet
communications. Her linguistics Ph.D. was being used to real purpose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I want you to help me think some, love,&quot; she went
on. &quot;I know it may sound a little bizarre, but I'd like to talk about some
of the legends surrounding this place. You know, try and sort out fact and
fiction.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now they were headed side by side down the stairway leading
into the central court, an expanse of sandstone and alabaster tile glinting
golden in the pale sun. On their left a flight of stairs seemed to lead out,
but in fact they led right back in again. The deceptions of the palace began at
the very entrance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The truth is, about all we have is stories, though sometimes
stories can be more true than so-called history. The standard version is that
this area was where the athletes performed ritual somersaults over the sacred
bulls.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The restored frescoes around them showed corridors crowded
with lithe Minoan priestesses, eyes rounded with green malachite, faces
powdered white, lips a blood red. They all were bare-breasted, wearing only
diaphanous chemises, while their jewels glistened in the sunshine as they
fanned themselves with ostrich plumes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There were no frescoes, however, of the powerful,
bloodthirsty King Minos.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael,&quot; she called out, her voice echoing off
the hard walls, &quot;you know, this place has always felt a little sinister to
me. None of the lightness and gaiety in those frescoes seems real.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's part of what made me start wondering if the
Minoans hadn't somehow managed to make a monkey out of every ponderous scholar
on the planet.&quot; They were moving down the monumental grand staircase,
three restored flights of which had originally been five, toward the rooms
called the royal chambers. &quot;Maybe the reason this place had no walls or
fortifications was because you only came here when you were dead. Who the hell
knows.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whatever the truth was, the eerie feeling of the palace
seemed to make the ancient stories even more vivid. The legends told that King
Minos's wife, Pasiphae, had a burning passion for one of the sacred white bulls
he kept, so she arranged for his chief architect, Daedalus, to design a hollow
wooden cow for her covered over with a hide. She concealed herself inside and,
as luck would have it, lured one of the beasts. The progeny of that union was
equally beastly—the Minotaur, a monster with a human body and a bull's head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now they were rounding a final corner in the twisting maze of
stairs. Directly ahead was the boudoir of the queen. The past welled up for
him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The frescoes over the alabaster arches showed bold blue
dolphins pirouetting in a pastel sea dotted with starfish and sea urchins. And
just beneath them stood the famous bathroom of the queen, connected to the vast
drainage complex of the palace, great stone channels curved in precise
parabolas to control and dampen turbulence. Daedalus was an engineer-architect
who had mastered the science of fluid dynamics thousands of years before the
invention of wind tunnels and supercomputers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My favorite spot. The bedroom.&quot; He slipped the
small bottle of ouzo from his trench coat pocket. In the dank of the palace's
lower depths, he needed its warmth. &quot;I've had unspeakably erotic thoughts
about this place—now it can be told—with you no small part of them.&quot; He
handed her the bottle. &quot;Want a hit of high octane?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Glad to know I've had a place in your memory all these
years, even if it was X-rated.&quot; She took the bottle with a knowing smile,
then drank. &quot;It's like licorice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He laughed. &quot;Blended with JP-7.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael,&quot; she continued, looking around,
&quot;maybe this is the very room where Pasiphae gave birth to the Minotaur.
What do you suppose?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That would fit the story.&quot; He moved on, his eyes
still adjusting to the shadows. &quot;The only thing the legends actually say
is that King Minos ordered Daedalus, resident genius, to create a secret
labyrinth in the cellar of the palace to keep the beast. But nobody's ever
located it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, I think the labyrinth was no myth. It was
real, only it was here. All around us. We're in it now.&quot; She handed back
the bottle. &quot;It was this whole sinister palace, this realm of the dead.
After all these years, I finally think maybe you were right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vindicated at last? Had even Eva come around? But why didn't
he feel any satisfaction? Instead he found himself aware of the old chill, the
almost occult intuition that had first told him the palace wasn't the happy
playground everybody supposed it was. Once more it felt like death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But now something else was entering his senses. Was it
imagination? In the encroaching dark the lower levels of the palace seemed to
be totally deserted, with only a couple of persistent German tourists arguing
out near the parking lot, and yet . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They weren't alone. He could feel it. He knew it. Was it the
spirits of the dead?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No, it was far more real. Someone was with them, somewhere.
In the shadows. They were being watched.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked at Eva, trying to make out her eyes in the
semidarkness. Did she sense it too? That somebody was nearby, waiting, maybe
listening?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Darling, let's talk some more about the myth of Daedalus.
In the version I remember he—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not much more to the tale. After a while a Greek prince
called Theseus arrived, to brave the labyrinth and do battle with the
man-eating Minotaur. When he showed up, King Minos's beautiful daughter,
Ariadne, instantly fell in love with him, naturally.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I love myths. They're always so realistic.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, he dumped her later, so I guess he did turn out
to be a creep. But anyway, she persuaded Daedalus to give him a ball of string.
He attached it to the door of the labyrinth and unwound it as he went in. After
he killed the beast, he followed the twine back out, and escaped. With Ariadne.
Unfortunately, when Minos discovered what had happened, he was so mad he locked
the great chief architect in a tower. But Daedalus managed to get out, hoping
to escape from the island. However, it wasn't going to be easy, since Minos had
clamped down on all the harbors, having the ships searched. That's when
Daedalus declared, 'Minos may control the land and the sea, but he doesn't
control the regions above.' And he constructed some wings, attached them to his
shoulders with wax, and soared away into space. First human ever. Up till then,
only the gods could just leave the earth anytime they wanted.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?&quot; She'd stopped dead still.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Daedalus. You remember. The first person to fly, mankind's
ago-old dream. In fact, a few years back some Americans duplicated the feat
with a human-powered glider. They made it from here on Crete over to the island
of—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, you said 'space.' &quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did I?&quot; He smiled. &quot;Call it poetic license.
But why not? Back in those days I guess the skies themselves could be
considered outer space, if they even knew such a thing existed.&quot; Then he
looked at her and sobered. &quot;What's—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's—it's just something that's been in the back of my
mind.&quot; She moved on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With a shrug, he took another drink of the ouzo and followed
her on down the hall toward the famous Throne Room. He was bracing himself now
for what was next.</span></p>

color:windowtext'>Its walls were decorated with frescoes of the massive Minoan
body shields, shaped as a figure-eight, that signified the men's quarters of
Knossos. And incised in stone above King Minos's wide alabaster throne was his
fearsome emblem of authority, symbol of his domination of the ancient world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There it was. He looked around, reassuring himself that it
was everywhere, just as he'd remembered. He'd also been right about something
else. It was precisely the same, right down to the smooth curves of the blade,
as the &quot;watermark&quot; that had been on the sheet of &quot;paper&quot;
Alex had given him. Almost four thousand years old, it was the insignia of the
new Daedalus Corporation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The dusk was settling majestically over Tokyo, after a rare
smogless day. The view was particularly inspiring from the fifty-fifth-floor
penthouse of the granite-clad Mino Industries building. The corner office was
an earth-tone tan, carpeted in a thick wool shag the color of elm bark. The
heavy doors at the far end of the office were emblazoned with a two-bladed ax,
and in the center of the wide expanse between the door and the single desk, on
a gleaming steel pedestal, stood a meter-long model of an airplane more
advanced than any the world had yet seen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The temperature of the room was kept at a constant 59 degrees
Fahrenheit, a frigid comfort-accommodation for the tawny, eight-foot snow
leopard named Neko now resting on a pallet beside the window, gazing down.
Remnant of an endangered species, she'd been rescued as a starving, motherless
cub during an expedition in the Himalayas and raised for the past six years as
a pampered pet of the penthouse's owner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Along the sound-proof walls were gilt-framed photographs of a
Japanese executive jogging with Jimmy Carter in Tokyo, golfing with Ferdinand
Marcos in Manila, receiving an accolade from Linus Pauling in San Francisco,
dining with Henry Kissinger in Paris. He was the same man now sitting behind
the massive slate desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You believe he was an American?&quot; Tanzan Mino, president
and CEO of the Daedalus Corporation, a paper creation of the Mino Industries
Group, adjusted his pale silk tie and examined the subordinate now standing
before him. He had just turned seventy-three, but the energy in his youthful
frame made him seem at least a decade younger, perhaps two.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Hai</i>, Mino-sama.&quot; The other man, in a dark
suit, bowed. &quot;We have reason to believe the Russian has . . . they were
seen exchanging an envelope.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And your people failed to intercept either of
them?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The man bowed again, more deeply. &quot;An attempt was made,
but unfortunately the Soviet escaped, and the American . . . my people were
unsure what action to take. We do know the funds have not been deposited as
scheduled.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tanzan Mino sighed and brushed at his silver temples. His
dark eyes seemed to penetrate whatever they settled upon, and the uncomfortable
vice-president now standing in front of him was receiving their full ire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Back in the old days, when he directed the Mino-gumi clan's
operations at street level, finger joints were severed for this kind of
incompetence. But now, now the organization had modernized; he operated in a
world beholden to computers and financial printouts. It was a new age, one he
secretly loathed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd been worried from the start that difficulties might
arise. The idiocy of Japan's modern financial regulations had driven him to
launder the payoffs thoroughly. In the old days, when he was Washington's man,
controlling the Liberal Democratic Party, no meddling tax agency would have
dared audit any of his shadow companies. But after a bastard maverick named
Vance—with the CIA, no less!— had blown the whistle on his and the Company's
clandestine understanding . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had arranged the initial financing for the project, as
well as the political accommodations, with letters of credit, promissory notes,
and his word. And, eventually, if need be, the full financing could be raised
by partial liquidation of his massive real estate holdings in Hawaii.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But the near-term expenses—and the necessary payoffs in the
LDP—that was different. In Japanese <i>kosaihi</i>, the &quot;money
politics&quot; of gifts and outright bribes, secrecy was everything. He
remembered how he'd had to arrange for the mighty Yoshio Kodama, a powerbroker
who had once shared his virtual ownership of the Japanese Diet and the Japanese
press, to accept responsibility for the CIA-Lockheed bribe affair. It was a
close call. That had involved a mere twelve million of American cash to
Japanese politicians, but it had changed the rules forever. These days—
particularly after the Recruit debacle had disgraced the LDP yet again—money
had to be laundered and totally untraceable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Promises had been made, schedules signed off, the veil of
total secrecy kept intact. Everything was arranged. The Soviets, incompetents
that they were, had no inkling of the larger plan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now it all came down to the funds. He needed the money at
once.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned in his chair, pressed a gray button on his desk,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>and watched
the window blinds disappear into their frame. Neko rose from her languorous
pose, stretched her spotted white fur, and gazed down. This was the panoramic
view she loved almost as much as he did, for her perhaps it was the memory of a
snowy Himalayan crest; for him it was the sprawl of Tokyo, the elegant peak of
Mount Fuji to the west, the bustling port of Yokohama to the south. From this
vantage atop the powerful financial world of Japan, Tanzan Mino wanted two
final triumphs to crown his career. He wanted to see Japan become the
twenty-first century's leader in space, and he wanted his country finally to
realize its historic wartime objective: economic domination of the continent of
Asia, from Siberia to Malaysia, with freedom forever from the specter of energy
and resource dependence. The plan now in motion would achieve both.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He revolved again in his chair, ignored the subordinate
standing before his desk, and studied the model. It was a perfect replica,
one-hundredth the actual size, of the spaceplane that would revolutionize the
future, the symbol that would soon signify his country's transcendence in the
high-tech age to come.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then his gaze shifted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You were 'unsure what action to take'?&quot; He leaned
back, touching his fingertips together, and sadness entered his voice.
&quot;You know, there was a time when I thought Japan might still one day
recapture the spirit we have lost, the spirit of <i>bushido</i>. In centuries
gone by, a samurai never had to ask himself 'what action to take.' He acted
intuitively. Instinctively. Do you understand?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Hai, wakarimasu</i>.&quot; The man bowed stiffly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;I am prepared to funnel trillions of yen into
this project before it is over. Legitimate, clean funds. So the sum now in
question is almost inconsequential. However, it is the bait we need to set the
trap, and it must be handled exactly as I have specified.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Hai</i>, Mino-sama.&quot; Again he bowed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;The next time you stand before me, I want to
hear that the laundered Soviet funds have been deposited in the Shokin Gaigoku
Bank as agreed. You have one week.&quot; He slowly turned back to the window.
&quot;Now, must I tell you what you have to do?&quot; The man bowed low one
last time. He knew exactly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael! And Eva!  Again, after so long. <i>Pos iste!</i>
What a surprise!&quot; The old Greek's sunburned face widened into a smile, his
gray mustache opening above his last good teeth. &quot;<i>Parakalo</i>, you
must come in for a glass of <i>raki</i> and some of Adriana's <i>meze</i>. She
would never forgive me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They'd dropped by the hotel, then come here. Although Zeno's
small taverna was in the center of <i>Iraklion</i>, its facade was still
country style, covered with an arbor. A bare electric bulb hung incongruously
in the middle of the porch, penetrating the dull glow of dusk now settling over
the square called Platia Eleftherias, where the evening's <i>volta</i> was just
beginning. Once the chaste promenade of eligible young women, it was now a
deafening flock of motorscooters, with girls in tight jeans riding on their
backs. And the watchful mothers of old were conspicuously absent. Times had
indeed changed since his last time here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Zeno.&quot; Vance shook his hand, then accepted his
warm embrace. As he was driving, he'd been wondering what the old Greek would
think about the sudden reappearance of Eva. They hadn't been here together
since that last trip, well over a decade ago. &quot;Still pouring the meanest <i>raki</i>
in this town?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But of course. Never that tequila you like,
Michael.&quot; He chuckled with genuine pleasure, recalling that Vance could
down his high-potency version of <i>ouzo</i> like a native. &quot;Ah, you know,
Michael, your father would never touch it. You, though . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He beckoned them through the <i>kafeneion's</i> doorway,
leading the way with a limp. The interior was dark, redolent of Greek
cigarettes and <i>retsina</i> wine. Overwhelming it all were the smells of the
kitchen—pungent olive oil and onions and garlic and herbs, black pepper and
oregano. Although lighting was minimal, around the rickety wooden tables could
be seen clusters of aging Greeks drinking coffee and <i>raki</i> and gossiping.
The white clay walls resounded with the clacks of <i>komboloi</i> worry beads
and <i>tavli</i>, Greek backgammon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But then,&quot; Zeno continued, &quot;that last trip,
your birthday present to him. On his retirement. Do you remember? When we three
were sitting at that very table, there in the corner. He called for a bottle of
my <i>raki</i> and shared a glass with me. We both knew it was our
good-bye.&quot; His eyes grew misty with emotion. &quot;Yes, coming here
finally with his famous son was a kind of benediction, Michael. He was passing
the torch to you, to continue his work.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This last was uttered with a slightly censorious tone. But it
quickly evaporated as he turned and bowed to Eva, then took her hand in a
courtly gesture. The old Greeks in the room would have preferred no women save
an obedient mate in their male sanctuary, but traditional hospitality conquered
all. &quot;It is so good to see you two back together.&quot; He smiled warmly
as he glanced up. &quot;Welcome once again to our humble home.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She bowed back, then complimented him in turn, in flawless
Greek.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So beautiful, and so accomplished.&quot; He beamed.
&quot;You still are the treasure I remember. You are a goddess.&quot; He kissed
her hand. &quot;As I've told Michael before, you could well be from this
island. No, even more. You could be Minoan. You bear a fine resemblance to the
'<i>parisiennes'</i> of the palace. Did he ever tell you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not often enough.&quot; She flashed him her sexiest
smile. &quot;But then he never had your eye for women.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah,&quot; the old man blushed, &quot;I have more than
an eye. If I were thirty years younger, you and I—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Zeno, before you drown Eva in that legendary charm, let
me bring her up to date,&quot; Vance laughed. &quot;She is now in</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>the presence
of the man who has probably become the richest tavern owner in all of
Crete.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was true. Zeno Stantopoulos had indeed become a wealthy
man, in many ways. His father had once farmed the land on which now stood the
unearthed palace at Knossos. The handsome sum Sir Arthur Evans paid for the
site was invested in bonds, which he then passed on to Zeno just before the
war. Zeno had the foresight to convert them to gold and hide it in Switzerland
during the German occupation of Crete. After the war, he used it to purchase
miles and miles of impoverished olive groves in the south, which he nursed back
to full production. These days oil went up, oil went down, but Zeno always made
a profit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His real wealth, however, was of a different kind. Zeno
Stantopoulos knew everything of importance that happened on Crete. His <i>kafeneion</i>
was the island's clearinghouse for gossip and information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't listen to him, madam.&quot; He winked and
gestured them toward the wide table in back, near the kitchen. It was known far
and wide as the place of honor, the location where Zeno Stantopoulos held
court. It had also been the nerve center of the Greek resistance during the
Nazi occupation, when Zeno had done his share of killing and dynamiting. The
limp, however, came from the fifties, when he was imprisoned and tortured by
the right-wing colonels for organizing popular resistance against them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come, let us celebrate with a glass of my <i>raki</i>.&quot;
He turned again to Eva. &quot;I should remind you. You once called it liquid
fire.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He clapped for Adriana, who squinted through the kitchen
door, her black shawl wrapped tightly about her shoulders. When she finally
recognized them, she hobbled forward, her stern Greek eyes softening into a
smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Neither of you has changed.&quot; Eva gave her a hug.
&quot;You both look marvelous.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Time, my friends, time. That has changed,&quot; Zeno
went on. &quot;I use a cane now, for long walks. The way Michael's father did
his last time here. When I saw him I thought, old age must be God's vengeance
on us sinners. And now it has happened to me.&quot; He smiled, with a light
wink. &quot;But I will tell you a secret. Ask Adriana. I do not yet need a cane
for all my exercise.&quot; He nodded affectionately in her direction. &quot;I
can still make this beauty wake up in the mornings singing a song.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was true, Vance suspected. Adriana had hinted more than
once that every night with him was still a honeymoon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah, Michael,&quot; he sighed, &quot;I still miss seeing
your beloved father on his summer trips here. Together you two inspired our
soul. The ancient soul of Crete.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that point Adriana bowed and announced she must return to
the kitchen, where she was putting the final touches to her proprietary version
of <i>kalamarakia</i>, fried squid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her peasant face hid well her peasant thoughts. Almost. Vance
had known her long enough to read her dark eyes. She didn't quite know what to
make of Eva's reappearance yet. Speaking passable Greek, it was true, which
counted for much, but she still wore no wedding band. <i>Adinato</i>!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, don't let Adriana stuff you.&quot; Zeno
watched her disappear, then turned. &quot;To your health.&quot; He clicked
their small glasses together. &quot;<i>Eis hygeian</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Eis hygeian</i>.&quot; Vance took a sip, savoring
the moment. Seeing old friends again, real friends, was one of life's most
exquisite pleasures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And tell me, how long will you two be visiting with us
this time?&quot; Zeno's Cretan hospitality flowed unabated. &quot;Perhaps
longer than the last? Have you finally decided to come back to stay, maybe make
us famous all over again?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Can't speak for Eva, but I've been asked to look in on
the new German excavation down at Phaistos. A project to try and restore the
palace there, the way Evans reconstructed Knossos.&quot; He glanced over. She
was now sipping the tepid <i>raki</i> with the gusto she normally reserved for
ice-cold Stolichnaya. &quot;Tonight, though, we're just tourists. Here to see
you two again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment, Adriana reappeared from the kitchen bearing
an enormous oak tray. With a flourish she laid before them fried squid and goat
cheese and stuffed grape leaves and octopus and wooden bowls of <i>melidzanosalata</i>,
her baked eggplant puree flavored with garlic, onions and herbs, not forgetting
her speciality, pink <i>taramasalata</i> made of mullet roe and olive oil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Incidentally, we were just out at Knossos, the palace,
this afternoon.&quot; Vance took a bite of <i>kalamarakia</i> while she looked
on approvingly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah, of course, the palace,&quot; Zeno smiled. &quot;I
love it still. I probably should go more myself, if only to remember the days
of my childhood, during the restoration. But with all the tour buses. ...&quot;
He chewed on a sliver of octopus as he glanced out toward the music in the
street. &quot;Perhaps it should be better cared for these days. But, alas, we
are not as rich now as King Minos was.&quot; He shrugged and reached for a roll
of <i>dolmadakia</i>. &quot;Still, we are not forgotten. Today, perhaps, we
count for little in the eyes of the world, but your book brought us fleeting
fame once again. Scholars from everywhere came—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hoping to prove me wrong.&quot; Vance laughed and took
another sip of <i>raki</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What does it matter, my friend. They came.&quot; He
brightened. &quot;Even today. Just to show you. Today, there was a man here,
right here, who was carrying your famous work on the palace. He even—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Today?&quot; Vance glanced up. Had he been right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, this very day. Outside in the arbor. He even sampled
some of Adriana's <i>meze</i>.&quot; He nodded at her. &quot;I did not like
him, and only our friends are welcome inside, book or no book.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Was he going out to Knossos?&quot; Eva interjected suddenly,
staring. &quot;To the palace?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He asked about it. Why else have the book?&quot; He
shrugged again, then examined the octopus bowl, searching for a plump piece.
&quot;You know, Michael, I could never finish that volume of yours entirely.
But your pictures of the frescoes—&quot; He paused to chew his octopus, then
smoothed his gray mustache and turned again to Eva, &quot;the frescoes of the
women. I love them best of all. And every now and then I see a woman here in
life who looks like them. Not often, but I do. And you are one of those rare</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>creatures,
my Eva. I swear you are Minoan.&quot; He turned back. &quot;Look at her,
Michael. Is it not true?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Zeno,&quot; Eva reached for his gnarled hand.
&quot;It's not like you to forget. My people are Russian, remember. From the
Steppes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah, of course. Forgive me. But you see, that only goes
to prove it.&quot; He nodded conclusively. &quot;The Minoans, we are told, came
from central Asia thousands of years ago. The 'brown-haired daughter of Minos'
was an oriental beauty, just as you are. I'm sure of it. Look at the
frescoes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Zeno, tell me.&quot; Vance reached to pour more <i>raki</i>
into their glasses. &quot;The man you mentioned just now. Was he Greek?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, he was a foreigner.&quot; He chewed thoughtfully.
&quot;I've never seen anyone quite like him. He had a strange way of speaking.
In truth, Michael, I did not like him at all. Not a bit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What exactly did he say?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It wasn't that. It was something else. I don't
know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And he went? To the palace?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I saw him hire a taxi, that was all. But whether he went
there or somewhere in the south, only God could know.&quot; He looked away.
&quot;Perhaps tomorrow I could find out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did this man have a beard?&quot; He pressed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, the thing I remember most was that part of one
finger was missing. Curious. I focused on that. But his features, his features
were almost Asian I would say.&quot; He paused, then turned and asked Adriana
to fetch another bottle of <i>raki</i>. &quot;Perhaps his accent was from that
part of the world.&quot; He looked back at Eva. &quot;I suppose you would have
known, my marvelous Eva, my Minoan queen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His eyes lingered on her a moment longer, then he rose.
&quot;Enough. Now we must all have something for dinner. I'm sure you do not
want to spend the rest of the night trapped here with a crippled old
Greek.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He disappeared into the kitchen to select the pick of the
day's catch. And that smoky evening they dined on the island's best—<i>barbounia</i>,
red mullet, which Adriana grilled with the head and served with wedges of
Cretan lemon. Afterward came a dessert of grapes and soft, fresh <i>myzithra</i>
cheese blended with dark honey from the mountains near Sfakii. Then at the end
she brought forth her own <i>soumada</i>, a rich nectar made of pressed
almonds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After more <i>raki</i>, Zeno was persuaded to get out his ancient
<i>bouzouki</i>, tune it, and play and sing some traditional songs. The music
grew faster and more heated, and then— with only the slightest urging—Eva
cleared away the tables and began to dance. Her Russian gypsy movements seemed
almost Greek.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When they finally broke away the time was nearly midnight;
the <i>volta</i> had long-since disbanded; the sky above had changed from a
canopy of island stars to a spring torrent. And Michael Vance and Eva Borodin
were very, very drunk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=bookmark15><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, there was something special about us in the
old days,&quot; Vance said as they weaved down the rain-washed street toward
the hotel. &quot;How we used to be. All we did was eat, drink, and talk. And
make love. Tonight it's three down and one to go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're pretty smashed, darling.&quot; Eva laughed and
looked him over. &quot;A girl learns to watch out for deceptive
advertising.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He slipped his arm around her. Eleven years, and in a way,
this was like it was all happening over again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I never shirk from a challenge.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll drink to that.&quot; Her voice indicated the
challenge would not be overly daunting. &quot;Do we have any—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's still that bottle of <i>ouzo</i> in the
car.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stopped dead still, her hair plastered against her
upturned face, and ran her hands down her body. &quot;Minoan, that's what Zeno
said. What if it's true?&quot; She turned back. &quot;What if I have the same
hot blood as the queen who vamped a bull? Imagine what that would be
like.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As best I remember, you could probably handle it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She performed another Russian gypsy whirl in the glistening
street. &quot;I want to be Minoan, Michael. I want to soar through time and
space. Leap over bulls, maybe even . . .&quot; She twirled again, drunkenly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then why not do it? The queen's bedroom.&quot; He
stopped and stared at the Galaxy Hotel, ultramodern and garish, now towering
upward in the rain. The pool was closed, but the disco still blared. &quot;The
hell with everything. I'm taking you back there. Tonight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Parked next to the lobby entrance was their rented Saab. He
paused and looked in at the half bottle of ouzo lying on the seat, then reached
and pulled her into his arms. &quot;Come on. And get ready.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is that a promise?&quot; She curled around and met his
lips.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Time's a wastin .&quot; He kissed her again and began
searching for his keys.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was unsteadily examining the darkened interior of her
purse. &quot;I think I've got an emergency candle in here. We'll use it for
light. Just enough.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I just hope I'm not too wrecked to drive in the
rain.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'd better not be. I know I am.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who cares? Let's just go for it.&quot; He was unlocking
the car and helping her in, loving the feel of her body, her scent. He'd
decided he was ready for anything and anybody, including some mysterious
stranger carrying his book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The night was brisk, with flares of spring lightning over the
mountains. As the Saab weaved through the narrow streets leading out of town,
Eva climbed up and drunkenly unlatched its sunroof to let in the rain. By the
time they reached the winding country road, headlights piercing the downpour,
the wind was rushing around them, wild and free.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When they pulled into the parking lot of Knossos it was
deserted, and they easily discovered an opening in the guard fence. The palace
lay before them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Piece of cake.&quot; He took her hand and helped her
through the wire. &quot;I propose a toast right here. To the past and to the
future.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If I drink much more of this, I may not be around to
see the future, but I'll die happy.&quot; She reached for the slippery bottle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they moved through the abandoned central court, eerie in
the rain, he could almost hear the roars of the crowd four thousand years past,
see the spotted bulls charging the nubile athletes. A heavy gust flickered her
candle, adding mystery to the shadows dancing across the enigmatic women of the
frescoes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now I really do feel Minoan.&quot; She headed down the
grand staircase, brandishing the light. Then she called out, her voice
resounding down the maze of windy hallways, &quot;I am the queen. I am
Pasiphae. Where's my white bull?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Eva, you're drunk,&quot; he yelled after.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm intoxicated. It's different.&quot; She laughed, low
in her throat. &quot;I'm intoxicated by the palace. The thought of my bull, the
eternal male.&quot; Her voice echoed more. &quot;Know about eternal males,
darling? They're like eternal females, only harder.&quot; She grinned at him,
then proceeded, tracing the wide marble steps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she floated down, carrying the candle, the moist air was
scented with jasmine, alive with the music of crickets. They rounded the last
curving steps, and the ornate vista of the queen's bedroom spread before them,
its blue dolphins cavorting in their pastel sea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He walked over and patted the alabaster portico. &quot;Hard
as this, your eternal male? This is a real test for the eternal female
bottom.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She threw herself down, then reached and ran a drunken
readiness check across his wet thigh. &quot;I'm ready for something hard inside
me.&quot; Her voice was strange, detached and ethereal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When did you start talking like that?&quot; He loved
it. &quot;Not even in the old days—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When I became Minoan, darling. When I became the blood
relation of Queen Pasiphae.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She wiggled out of her soaked brown dress and tossed it onto
the floor. As he watched her begin to sway before the fresco of the dolphins,
he had the definite feeling time was in a warp, that the flow of centuries was
in reverse. Maybe Eva was none other than Pasiphae reborn. The room was
perfumed and serene, perfect for a queen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she bent down and carefully stationed her candle on the
stone. Looking up she said, &quot;Let me have some more of that <i>ouzo</i>. I
love being here. It's shocking and wonderful.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No, this was most assuredly the modern Eva. As she moved
against him, her body felt the way he remembered it. Riper now perhaps, with a
voluptuousness slightly more toward Rubens than Botticelli, but the skin of her
breasts, her thighs, was soft as ever. And the dark triangle was still luxuriant,
redolent with her scent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do it. Hard. Like a bull. I want to know what she
felt.&quot; She drew back across the stone as he drove inside her.
&quot;Yes&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While rain slammed against the courtyard above, the ancient,
foreboding room began to engulf and rule their senses; the feel of her perfumed
nipples against him was hard and urgent. It was an erotic moment outside of
time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now her head thrashed from side to side as quivering orgasms
rippled through her, starting in her groin and welling upward as she arched and
flung back her hair. Then she drew up, clinging, as though trying to consume
him, herself, in a rite of pure bacchanalian frenzy. Her breath had become
labored, not gasps of pleasure, but the need of one seeking air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Eva, Eva, he suddenly caught himself thinking, you're here
for release, escape. I know you too well. You're not really in this room
anymore. You want to be but you're not. You're somewhere in a realm of beasts
and magic and the bloodthirsty Minotaur.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But yet, yet . . . somehow he'd never felt closer . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A final convulsion brought them together and then she fell
back, dazed. The candlelight flickered across the alabaster, sending ghostly
apparitions against the fresco of the dolphins. Still trying to catch her
breath, she reached out and seized the bottle of ouzo, drank from it thirstily,
then flung herself once more against the stone. After another long moment, she
pulled him to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, hold me.&quot; She snuggled into his arms.
&quot;Oh, darling, just hold me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He drew her against him, and the touch of her skin was erotic
beyond anything he remembered. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But the palace . . . it was intruding darkly, insinuating its
presence. Now it surrounded them like a tomb, ominous as death. Finally he
turned her face up and examined her dark eyes. They were flooded with fear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, you've got to tell me what's going on. I want to
know the real reason you're here, and I want to know it now. I'd somehow begun
to hope it was for us, but—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's part of it, darling. Truly.&quot; She kissed him
deeply on the mouth, then reached and began fishing in her purse for the
battered pack of Dunhills, trying to regain her bravado. &quot;God, that was
hot. I do love being here with you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're stalling. Whenever you don't—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're right.&quot; She took out a cigarette, flicked her
lighter, and drew a lungful of smoke. &quot;Now I see why Pasiphae was such a
number. This room does something to you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not bad for starters.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked down, then smiled. &quot;No, darling, you're just
bluffing. I remember that well enough. Plenty of time for a cigarette.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Some things improve with age.&quot; He studied her
beautifully disheveled form. Now more than ever he realized she was scared.
&quot;Goddammit, enough. Talk to me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right.&quot; She sighed, then leaned back on the
ledge of the portico. &quot;Well, to begin at the beginning, I've been seeing
somebody lately.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Make you a deal,&quot; he interrupted. &quot;You spare
me your stories and I'll spare you mine. This doesn't really seem the moment to
start swapping indiscretions.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll bet you've got plenty to swap yourself.&quot; She
looked him over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hold on a minute.&quot; Sure, there'd been women in and
out of his life. He wasn't a priest. Besides, he liked women.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Darling, relax.&quot; She patted his thigh. &quot;We're
both adults. You said you wanted to hear this, so for godsake listen. His name
was Jerry Ackerman and . . . it started back about nine months ago. Since he
was new, he'd drop by my office now and then. You know, to learn the
ropes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What kind of ropes, exactly?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Really, Michael. Anyway, he wasn't exactly world class
in the boudoir, if that makes you feel any better. Though needless to say I
never told him that. Our little scene tonight would have blown his Brooklyn
mind. Now does that preserve your precious male ego? He was just nice, and
interesting.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Was?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll get to that.&quot; She was tracing small circles
on the alabaster. &quot;Week before last he dropped off a computer disk at my
office. Said he couldn't figure it out. And it was old, maybe two weeks. Which
was unusual, especially for satellite intercepts, which this was. Normally we
get them the same day. So I ran it through my desk station, figuring it
couldn't be that big a deal.&quot; She paused nervously, then went on.
&quot;Well, the first part was encoded using one of the standard Soviet
encryption systems we've had cracked for years, and it had a lot of proper
names. But the rest of it was just a string of numbers. No matter what I tried,
I got nothing but garbage.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Really? I thought Fort Meade's football field of Cray
supercomputers could crack anything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I thought so too. But this encryption was either so
clever, or so simple, nothing seemed to click. I couldn't do it. I even began
to wonder, maybe it's not a cipher at all. Maybe it's just some obscure foreign
language. So I matrixed it against some we have in the data base. And, love,
we've got them. A zillion megabytes of memory. Serbo-Croatian, Urdu, Basque . .
.&quot; She drew on her cigarette, sending a glow into the dark. Above them the
rain continued to pound. &quot;But I still couldn't find anything that would
crack it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Doesn't sound like you.&quot; He drew her around and
kissed her. &quot;Half the time you're too smart for your own good.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Apparently not smart enough.&quot; She hugged him back
automatically, then continued. &quot;When I told Jerry I couldn't break the
encryption, he suddenly got very nervous. Said okay, then he'd just take it and
try again himself. So I asked him to sign it out on my log. Just routine. And
that's when he started acting strange. At first he refused, but finally he did
it when I said, 'It's like this, sweet buns. No tickee, no washee.' By then
he'd stopped coming over to my place and things had gotten a little strained at
the edges, to put it mildly. So I didn't think too much about it at the
time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't start telling me more about—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, that was the last time anybody saw him. He
just vanished. That night. There was even something in the paper. 'Mysterious
disappearance.' The apartment where he lived had been dismantled. Top to
bottom. Somebody must have thought he was holding out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, it just so happened I still had it in computer
memory, though that's a blatant violation of security procedures. Anyway, the
next day I called Control and said what's with a certain file? Gave them the
NSCID number. And they said, 'We have no record of that number.' Quote. They'd
never heard of it. So it must have been a free-lance job for somebody outside.
Whoever it was must have paid Jerry, or maybe blackmailed him, into getting me
to take a crack at it. Which is why it was two weeks old. It wasn't NSA
material at all. Somebody else wanted it, and I'm known far and wide as Ms.
Give-Her-the-Tough-Ones.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You always were the best.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right.&quot; She laughed, then reached into her purse
and retrieved a three and a half inch gray computer disk. &quot;And here it is.
A complete copy. I've also got it stored on the eighty-meg hard drive of my
Zenith Turbo 486 laptop back at the hotel.&quot; She tossed it to him.
&quot;Jerry's file. That's the good news. The bad news is, it's still
encrypted.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned it in his fingers. Welcome to the new age, he
thought, when thousands of pages can be packed onto a high-density disk the
size of a casette tape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She took out a compact from her purse and powdered her nose
in the light of the candle, then turned and searched the stone for her crumpled
dress. He thought he heard a sound from the hallway outside, but then decided
it was just more thunder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So now what?&quot; She finally found the dress and drew
it loosely on, managing not to secure the bustline. &quot;I've tried and tried
to crack it, but nothing seems to click. After the preamble, there's nothing on
there but a long string of numbers. Whatever it is, it's not any of the
standard encryption systems.&quot; She reached to take it back. &quot;Why am I
telling you all this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Because we've agreed, no more games.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Darling, there're actually two reasons why I shouldn't.
One is I hate to drag you into it, and the other . . . well, there's
more.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm waiting.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Whatever's on here is part of something bigger. I know
that because of the preamble, the section I can read.&quot; She pushed ahead,
nervousness in her voice. &quot;Anyway, that's when I decided I had to talk to
you. About some of the things you used to work on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He inhaled. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There were some proper names.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't get—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In the preamble. One was 'Daedalus.' And another was
'Mino.' So I thought, why not talk to Michael? It sounded like something that
you'd . . . I don't know . . . maybe you could help me think. Anyway, I finally
decided to take a chance and ring you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Great. Nice to finally learn exactly where I fit
in.&quot; He lay silent for a moment, trying to suppress his annoyance. Finally
he told himself, Be constructive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right, tell me what you think it's all about.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well.&quot; She paused again, as though unsure. Finally
she spoke, her voice faint above the rain. &quot;Did you know the Soviet Union
and Japan never actually signed a peace treaty after World War Two?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's because the Soviets kept some Japanese islands,
right? Seem to recall they were the Kuriles, and also the southern half of
Sakhalin.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Japan calls those the Northern Territories, and they've
refused to sign because of them.&quot; She reached over and adjusted the
candle, surveying the dark around them. The gloom was almost Stygian.
&quot;Well, hang on to your diplomatic pouch, because I think they're about to
sign. Maybe as the first step toward . . . I'm still not sure what.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He caught his breath. &quot;How did you find out about
this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Intelligence. I've been handling our intercepts. But we
still haven't put together a briefing package for the president, and State. It
just seems so implausible nobody wants to be the one to sign off on it.
Besides, nothing's settled. Among other things, the Japanese Diet would
eventually have to vote to approve it, and nothing's come through diplomatic
channels. It's being closely handled by somebody big and anonymous over there.
Anyway, my hunch is a vote in the Diet would be a squeaker. Your average
Japanese man on the street still isn't too enthusiastic about the
Soviets.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He leaned back to think. Given today's global realities, a
deal like that had to be the tip of some gigantic iceberg. In diplomacy, there
was always give and take.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And you believe whatever's on this disk is somehow
connected to the treaty?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's precisely what I believe,&quot; she sighed.
&quot;The treaty has a secret protocol involved. It's hinted at in the
intercepts, but never described. And I've got a feeling, somehow, that this is
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Doesn't sound like something that would delight
Washington.&quot; He pondered. &quot;On the other hand, what could the U.S. do
anyway? The American military is a hell of a lot more worried about losing its
bases in Japan, not to mention NSA's Soviet and Chinese listening posts, than
the Japanese are about giving up our so-called protection. There's not a damned
thing the U.S. could do about it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd guess whoever's behind this fully realizes
that.&quot; She paused, letting a roll of thunder from above die away.
&quot;But the protocol . . . nobody has any idea what's in it, not even the
KGB. I also know that from our intercepts.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is getting more interesting by the minute.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, stay tuned. There's more still. As it happens,
I'm also on NSA's oversight panel, the Coordinating Committee. We assemble
briefing packages that bring together reports from all the departments, including
PHOTOINT, photo intelligence from satellite surveillance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The 'spy in the sky' recon? Big Bird, KH-12, radar
imaging?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, we review all of that, sure. But think about it.
The Soviets have surveillance satellites too. And p.s., their Cosmos series can
now relay down digital imagery in real time.&quot; She paused. &quot;It's
classified, but put two and two together. If NSA intercepts Soviet voice and
data communications . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stealing pictures from their spy satellites?&quot; He
knew about it. &quot;Why not? All's fair in love and war, I think the saying
goes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, just pretend you dreamed it up.&quot; She sighed.
&quot;Now, from here on it gets a little off-the-wall. So off-the-wall
everybody at NSA refuses to take it seriously. The committee keeps wanting to
study everything, but I think time's running out. Something's going to happen
any day now, but—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Something bad?&quot; He tried to make out her eyes in
the dark, wondering what she was still holding back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, I shouldn't . . .&quot; She reached over and
took another cigarette out of her purse. &quot;Anyway, the reason I wanted you
here was to help me find some answers. Before somebody decides to try and make
me disappear too. Like Jerry.&quot; She flicked at her lighter three times
before it finally flared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe, he thought, she had good reason to be afraid. He
remembered the odd sense that afternoon that they were being watched. And then
Zeno mentioning a stranger carrying his book. It was beginning to seem less and
less like a coincidence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But, Jesus,&quot; she went on. &quot;Now they've found
me. And I've drawn you into it. I'm really—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just relax.&quot; Mainly now he wanted to calm her
down. &quot;Nobody's found—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't you see? Alex. Just happens to call you this morning
as you were on your way here to see me. Don't flatter yourself. That call was
about me. Which means he knows I've got . . .&quot; Her hand quavered as she
dropped the lighter back into her purse. &quot;There's already been one
murder—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, slow down. Take it easy. Novosty's never scared
me, even when he's tried. Just—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's not him I'm worried about. Michael, if even a
TDirectorate sleaze like Alex knows, then who else . . .&quot; The darkened
room fell silent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'd better tell me all of it. Everything.&quot; Again
he paused, thinking he heard a sound from somewhere in the dark. But it was impossible.
Nobody could have followed them here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right.&quot; She let the words tumble out, finally.
&quot;Yes, we intercept all the Soviet satellite photos. Just the way you
thought.&quot; She exhaled, then rose and paced the room a moment, its walls
now ghostly in the candlelight. &quot;Well, lately for some strange reason
their Soyuz series always seems to have a temporary malfunction whenever they
pass over one certain spot on the globe. Almost as though somebody were turning
off their KFA-1000 high-resolution cameras. I kept noticing it, but nobody else
in PHOTOINT thought it was anything but a coincidence. Still, it got me
wondering. What if somebody over there is pulling a number on the KGB, or the
GRU? Keeping them from seeing something. So I had some of our own photos of
that grid sent over, from the new KH-12.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where was it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, it wasn't necessarily where you'd think. It was
the Japanese island of Hokkaido. And the high-resolution grid missing was just
the northern tip.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I went back and checked a series of KH-12 recon photos,
taken over the last two years. There's something new there now, Michael. Just
this last year or so. It's been partly camouflaged, but I think it's a new
runway. Or launch facility. Or something. And the radar maps show some funny surface
irregularities. At least I think they do. Nobody else at NSA . . .&quot; She
looked away. &quot;But put it together. Maybe that's part of the treaty
somehow, their secret protocol. Some joint—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A launch facility? Eva, that's impossible. The Japanese
space program is all down on Tanegeshima Island, south of Tokyo. The island of
Hokkaido is way up north. There's nothing up there but Holsteins and hay
fields.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But, he thought suddenly, it's also just across from
Sakhalin. The Soviet Far East. The place the party secretary who embezzled . .
.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This isn't hay fields, darling, believe me.&quot; Her
voice seemed to drift out and blend with the rain. &quot;Something you said
this afternoon, that's what made it click. About the first man to leave the
earth and soar into space . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I didn't ask for this. Oh, Christ, how did I . .
.&quot; She paused again, uncertain. &quot;You know, I finally think I've
figured out what's happening, why it's so secret—the treaty, the protocol,
cutting out their own intelligence. It's partly about space, all right. Has to
be. Something's cooking, something they're eventually going to spring on the
world like the first Sputnik.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You still haven't decoded the damned thing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, I'm guessing. But how's this? Somebody at the
top, in the USSR, has decided to go for a giant gamble. To save their system,
they've been forced to turn to some nutcakes in Japan who can loan them
billions. And this project is part of it. The Soviets once cut a deal with Nazi
Germany to buy time, so why not? The leadership needs time now
desperately.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And you think—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Project Daedalus. That's the code name in the preamble.
Think about it. You know what I believe? To get the money and technology they
desperately need, the Russians have had to cave in and do the unthinkable. Form
a new alliance. Michael, they're about to start rearming Japan.&quot;</span></p>

color:windowtext'>, he thought; sometimes things can't be helped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Taro Ikeda was proud he had been personally selected by the
CEO to be project director for the top secret Hokkaido operation. He was
fifty-four years of age, a graduate of Tokyo University Law School, a
twenty-five-year veteran, now retired, of MITI, the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry. He was, in short, a mover in the New Japan and he looked
it—elegantly graying temples, tailored silk suits, a small mustache to set off
his high cheeks. At one time he had been the inside choice for MITI vice</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>minister,
before the CEO offered him a chance to fulfill a vision no official source in
the ministry could ever admit existed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Overall, he told himself, the CEO should be pleased. He had
carried out his own responsibilities flawlessly. And MITl was providing an
unofficial umbrella of technical support, covering any unexpected requirements.
Through this project the CEO had set into motion a plan that would soon alter
dramatically Japan's place in the equation of world power.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Bushido, the Way of the Warrior. The element of surprise. No
one outside Mino Industries knew what was really planned, not even the prime
contractors for the project. Security every step of the way. And now the drama
was ready, the curtain poised. Only a few more days, and a technological
miracle would soar upward from the earth, symbolizing the first step in the
realization of Japan's age-old ambition. The world would know the twenty-first
century had arrived, the Japanese century. Mino Industries had made it
possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The CEO's sense of timing was impeccable. Only last week he
had approved Taro Ikeda's final briefing to Noburu Takahashi, executive
director of the National Space Development Agency. NASDA, through contracts to
the Space Systems Division of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, was in charge of the
major hardware of the Japanese rocket program. Takahashi was also an executive
of the new Daedalus Corporation, an unofficial &quot;consultant.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Together they had traveled to the agency's space center on
Tanegeshima, the island six hundred miles south of Tokyo, to monitor the
shakedown launch of Japan's new H-2 rocket series. Although that vehicle was
far superior to both the American Titan 34D and the European Ariane 4, it was a
technological dinosaur compared to this project. This was unlike anything the
world had ever seen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The project had begun over two years earlier, when he was
still director of MITI's Kokuki Buki-ka, the Aircraft and Ordnance Section. An
&quot;anonymous&quot; scenario—conceived by the CEO of Mino Industries Group,
Tanzan Mino—had arrived on his desk, detailing a revolutionary proposal. Every
director in MITI had received a copy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The eventual &quot;consensus&quot;? It was too visionary,
would aggravate Japan's already delicate relationship with America. The Liberal
Democratic Party could never be seen to embrace such a project publicly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Accordingly, MITI's parliamentary vice minister turned it
down. Officially. But that was merely <i>tatame</i>, his &quot;public
face.&quot; Afterward the classified moves, the real moves, began. Perhaps, it
was hinted, if the idea were &quot;explored&quot; outside regular government
channels. . . . Top-secret feelers were sent to the Soviets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With a green light, Tanzan Mino had immediately created the
Daedalus Corporation, hiring away Taro Ikeda and forty-seven of his MITI
aerospace engineers, the best and brightest, from Kokuki Buki-ka. Start-up
financing had been provided by the CEO personally, with some matching
contributions by the top executives of Japan's major <i>zaibatsu</i>,
industrial groups. The scenario was an easy sell, since they all realized its
payoff would be staggering. The only requirement was that it remain top secret
until the appropriate moment, when the Diet would be formally notified. By that
time, however, there would be no turning back. Everything would have to go
forward as a package.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Under the CEO's direction, Taro Ikeda and his forty- seven
MITI engineers had relocated here on Hokkaido to oversee a secret, fast-track
project. Forty-seven. Perhaps, he sometimes mused, that number was no
coincidence. Perhaps it was an unconscious act of historical resonance.
Forty-seven brilliant young technicians, just like the forty-seven ronin, the
samurai of the famous legend. Those ronin had bided their time for many years,
living in obscurity and ignominy until the moment when they rose up in triumph.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Bushido</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
You must always make your opponent do battle on your own terms. And today money
and technology were Japan's most powerful weapons. Why not use them
strategically, the CEO had argued. The time had come to engage other
unsuspecting nations with concentrated strength, in a forcible move to achieve
Japan's long-term objectives. The Way of the Warrior.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Taro Ikeda surveyed his office, his personal command center.
The space was appointed like the headquarters of a field marshall: a deep
metallic gray with video screens along one wall permitting him continuously to
monitor activities in every sector of the facility. And across the top of his
black slate desk was marshalled a line of gray telephones with scramblers, each
a secure direct line to the offices of one of the project's prime contractors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first was to Nagoya, to the head office of Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries. Theirs was the initial contract let by the CEO after the
project financing was in place. Indeed, Mitsubishi's Nagoya Aircraft Works was
the ideal choice to manufacture the air-breathing turboramjets-scramjets for
the vehicle. That conglomerate had produced over fifty thousand aircraft
engines during the great Pacific war, and, more recently, their new Komaki
North plant was responsible for the powerful oxygen-hydrogen engines that
composed the first stage of the giant H-2 booster. The phone on his desk
connected him directly to the office of Yoshio Matsunami, Mitsubishi's general
manager for space systems. The massive scramjets for this project had been
manufactured in Nagoya under a veil of total secrecy, then static-tested at
their aeropropulsion test facility and individually shipped here to Hokkaido in
unmarked railcars.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Another line connected him to the head office of Nissan's
aeronautical and space division in Tokyo, already in charge of all solid rocket
boosters for the Japan Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science. The CEO had
hired their senior propulsion engineers to resolve problems connected with
air-breathing combustion of liquid hydrogen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The third connection was to Hitachi City, sixty miles from
Tokyo. Hitachi, Limited manufactured the booster cases for the new H-2 vehicle,
and their extensive experience with composite alloys at high-temperatures made
them the obvious choice to create the hypersonic airframe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There were other lines as well. The vehicle's inertial-
guidance system and flight controls—both based on advanced Soviet designs—had
been produced at Japan's National Aerospace Laboratory. Preliminary wind-tunnel
tests had been assigned to the Kakuda Propulsion Center, whose rocket-engine
development facilities were already being used to support NASDA's program in
oxygen-hydrogen thruster R&amp;D.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The last high-security line connected him directly to Tsukuba
Space Center at Tsukuba Science City, forty miles from Tokyo, the nerve center
for all Japanese manned space-flight research. Their clean-rooms and deep-space
tracking facilities were comparable to any in the world, and their Fujitsu
SX-10 supercomputer—which, with 128 processors for parallel processing,
performed nine billion calculations per second—could provide realtime
simulation of a complete hypersonic flight profile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Feeling impatient now to begin the day, Taro Ikeda settled
back and reached for the phones. Each contractor would give him a quick morning
update, and then he would outline any further component tests or retrofitting
as required. In truth, these exchanges had long since become scarcely more than
rituals, since the project was all but completed. The major components had
already been designed, delivered, and assembled. The contractors had been paid,
the reports and evidence of their participation declared top secret and locked
away from any possible prying eyes. All traces of the project had been safely secured.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was, he reminded himself, only one major problem
remaining. As part of the initial scenario, the Soviets had agreed to provide a
laundered payment of one hundred million American dollars, to be used for
Tanzan Mino's &quot;incidental expenses&quot; in the Liberal Democratic Party
hierarchy. To avoid another Recruit-bribe fiasco like the one that brought down
the prime minister in 1989, the money had to be scrupulously clean and totally
untraceable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But the funds had not arrived.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How the Soviets had secured the hard currency required
outside of regular government channels, he could not imagine. There were even
reports the money had been secretly &quot;embezzled&quot; from certain slipshod
ministries. That it was, in fact, hot money.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But if those funds didn't come through within eight days,
fully laundered, the project would have to be put on hold, as a matter of
strategy, and precaution. The treaty could not be placed before the Diet unless
passage was assured. Promises had to be kept.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What had happened to the money? Whatever it was, he thought
with a worried sigh, the CEO had better solve it and soon. If he didn't, the
whole project might have to be put on hold until next year's session of the
Diet, and their secrecy would probably be impossible to maintain for another
whole year. A disaster.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had just completed the last call when he noticed a
flashing alert on the main computer terminal, advising him that the morning's
hypersonic test in Number One was scheduled to begin at 0800 hours. He grunted
and typed in an acknowledgment. In his view it was a waste of time, overkill.
The SX-10's simulation had already taken them further than they needed to go.
But, all right, humor the Soviet team. It would only require a morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His contractor briefings now out of the way, he transferred
all communication channels to the computer modems that lined the walls, then
rose and walked back to the small alcove at the rear of his office. He paused a
moment to calm his thoughts, then slid aside the <i>shoji</i> screens to reveal
what was, for him, the most important room in the facility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Here in the North Quadrant the CEO had constructed a
traditional teahouse, <i>tatami</i>-floored with walls and ceiling of soft,
fresh cedar and pine. In this refuge Taro Ikeda performed an essential morning
ritual, the brief meditation that quieted his spirit. He knew well the famous
adage of swordsmanship, that the true master lives with his mind in a natural
state.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The challenge ahead would require all the discipline of a
samurai warrior, the Way of Zen. And the first rule, the very first, was your
mind must be empty, natural, unattached, in order to succeed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he seated himself on the reed surface of the <i>tatami</i>,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>zazen</span></i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>-style, he methodically began
clearing his mind. The moment was sacred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But then, drifting through unasked, came an admonition of the
great Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu. &quot;Intelligence is everything.
You must know your opponent's plan even before he knows it himself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was true. The security for this project had been airtight,
except for one minor breach. Someone in the Tokyo office had stupidly
transmitted the final protocol over an unsecured satellite channel. It had been
intercepted by Soviet intelligence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Fortunately, the Russian blunderers had been unable to
decipher the encryption. But someone—either in the KGB or the GRU—had been so
desperate he had secretly enlisted the assistance of the U.S. National Security
Agency's top cryptographer. It was a brilliant move, because NSA's
supercomputers might eventually be able to break the code.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When Tanzan Mino learned of the breach, he had given orders
that the NSA expert be neutralized, quickly, and the protocol retrieved. If it
became public knowledge prematurely, the entire scenario could be destroyed.
Now, happily, the NSA individual had been identified. The rest would be easy.
An unfortunate price to pay, but a simple solution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With that thought to comfort him, he gazed at the polished
natural woods of the teahouse and let his mind drift into perfect repose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first round went wide, nicking the edge of the dolphin
fresco. Vance listened, startled, at the explosion, at first thinking it was a
sharp crack of thunder from outside. Then he heard the bullet sing into the
dark, a high-pitched hiss. For a moment he wondered if he was dreaming, his
mind adrift in the bloody myths of the palace. Then a second explosion flared
from the direction of the archway, grazing his neck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Eva!</i>&quot; He threw his body across hers,
slamming her against the alabaster portico. His free hand slapped awkwardly at
the candle, crushing out the last sputter of flame. As he swung around, the
empty ouzo bottle clattered into the dark, spinning, its revolving sound a
beacon. Get it, he thought, and stretched across the stone to grope in the
dark. Finally he felt the smoothness of the glass gliding at the edge of his
reach. Slowly, carefully, his fingers circled the neck and he pulled it toward
him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room was black now, its silence deep as a tomb. Then the
gun flamed once more, and again, the two rounds ricocheting off the ancient
walls somewhere around them. After that, silence returned, no sound except for
the heave of breathing, whose he wasn't sure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he reached to quiet her, she whispered. &quot;Michael,
they want me.&quot; She tried to struggle up. &quot;You've got to let—'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No.&quot; He forced her back, whispering. &quot;We
can't leave when the party's just beginning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Still grasping the neck of the bottle, he moved silently
across the floor. The stone slabs were icy, while the night music of the rain
seemed to come from another world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He pressed against the wall, feeling for the doorway until he
sensed a shadow slip past, slowly edging into the room. The muzzle of a pistol
glinted against the flare of lightning outside, and he realized it was no more
than a couple of feet away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He swung the empty bottle with all his might, aiming for the
tip of the muzzle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The impact coursed up his arm as the bottle splintered
against the metal. The intruder's startled intake of breath was masked by the
clatter of the weapon against the stone floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'll reach for it, Vance told himself. Lots of luck, pal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He brought the fractured bottle upward with all his strength,
aiming for the face. Although the figure was still formless, he let instinct
guide his hand. The rough feel of shirt fabric brushed past his fingers and
then the softness of flesh. A scream of surprise pierced the dark. Bingo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Got the neck, he thought, and with a twist he drove the
shattered bottle in. A warm wetness gushed against his hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I hit an artery. Blind luck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The figure stumbled backward into the dim passageway. In a
flash of lightning Vance saw hands clawing at a neck. Then came the sound of
stumbling footsteps, retreating, and again silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Still gripping the sticky neck of the bottle, he bent down
and began to search the floor. Near his feet he felt a hot muzzle and followed
it upward to the still-warm grip. It was, he realized, a 9mm Baretta. He kept
an identical chrome-plated model on the Ulysses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All right, chum, now we'll have a rerun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Grasping it with both hands, in firing position, he turned
and peered out the open archway. The glimmers of distant lightning showed
nothing but stone walls and an empty passageway. All he could discern was the
vertical shaftway connecting the many levels of the palace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He pressed against the cold stone wall and edged into the
hallway leading toward the steps. Then he felt a sharp sensation against the
ball of his left foot and reached down. A spent cartridge shell, still warm,
lay up-ended on the icy floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Pasiphae, he suddenly found himself thinking. It's as though
Eva had lured the killer here, to this very room, like the white bull. And now
he, they, who knows how many? want to kill us both. Somebody realized she knows
too much.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He tried to control his breathing, straining to hear as the
adrenaline continued to pump. From the staircase up above, the crickets had
resumed their high-pitched medley. He listened as they chorused, the sounds of
centuries past, their hymn to the rain. There was nothing else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No, faint sounds ... far above, maybe in the central court.
Men were arguing. It was a heated exchange. He heard them grow louder, and with
that the metallic click of another automatic weapon being readied. He waited,
holding his breath, as the voices became even more animated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What had happened? There must have been two, maybe even more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good time to find a new place to party.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned back to the silent room. It was, he suddenly
realized, too silent. He felt his way back to the alabaster portico and reached
across.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Eva.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The quiet that followed told him he had been right; she'd
panicked, run. No, he thought, she only wants to save you. She thinks she drew
them here, and now she's trying to lure them away. Bad time to leave. Just when
things were getting interesting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He reached down and felt for the right-hand pocket of his
trousers, still lying crumpled in a pile on the floor. Finally he slid his hand
in and searched. The keys were gone. She had taken them, slipped away, left
nothing. No trace. Only the smashed candle remained.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Annoyed, he located a box of hotel matches in his shirt and
struck one. The room was empty, totally bare, its dolphins frisking alone in
their placid sea. Across, on the other side, was the passageway leading through
the queen's &quot;bathroom.&quot; Beyond it lay the labyrinthine twists of the
palace hallways. Perhaps by now Eva had found her way out and escaped. From the
maze of Daedalus?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He tried to think as he finished donning his wet clothes in
the dark. Eva clearly had gotten too close to somebody's plans. Where would she
go?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Cautiously he moved out and began to mount the marble
staircase, his rubber soles noiseless against the steps. The automatic was
beginning to feel comfortable, even though it had nearly taken his life only
minutes before. But he never trusted life to a chunk of metal, no matter how
efficient.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Above him the voices still quarreled, and he found himself
straining to catch the language. What was it? Greek? no, maybe Russian.
Whatever it was, a fierce argument was raging. Again he tried to guess how many
there were. He checked the metal clip and decided he had enough rounds to take
them all—if he had to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But that was getting ahead of the game. If she had eluded
them, then why bother? The best thing would be to try to slip past the
courtyard, get through the fence, maybe join her at the car. Then they could
move the party back to the hotel, keep the momentum. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He moved carefully on through the hall of the procession,
edging along the wall. Against his back he could feel the cold frescoes of the
cup bearers, locked in their sterile march through time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he heard another voice, this time female.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Pazdolba! Delaetye vcyo, shto vam yugodno—mnye vcyo</i>
...&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was Eva yelling in rapidfire Russian. Arguing, shouting
orders? He couldn't make it out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now he edged through the final archway, grasping the Baretta.
At that moment an eruption of gunfire splintered the silence, a fiery burst in
the rainy night, while Eva was yelling for it to stop. It was over as quickly
as it had come, but she was still screaming, swearing actually.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whoever was there, they were no more than thirty feet away.
But she was still safe. He could hear her curses, now half muffled in the
storm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Gingerly he edged on out through the entryway and stood at
the edge of the courtyard, Baretta cocked and ready. A lighter blossomed in the
rain, was brought upward to a cigarette, and momentarily framed a face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alex Novosty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was holding what appeared to be an Uzi, peering down at
the glistening stones. Sprawled across from him were two bodies, both in dark
raincoats. Now he was saying something to Eva in Russian, but she was staring
past him, toward the entryway where Vance stood. In a flare of lightning their
eyes locked, and he saw in hers anger and disbelief.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment the flame of the lighter was cut short, but
not before Novosty whirled and followed her gaze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Instinctively Vance threw himself against the inside wall of
the processionway. An instant later, the Uzi blazed again, drowning the sound
of Novosty's challenge. He held his own automatic, barely breathing, while the
rounds ricocheted against the stone walls. Was Eva part of it? What in hell . .
.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then her voice rose again, through the dark, a mixture of
Russian and English. She was screaming at Novosty. Finally she called out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael.&quot; A pause, then her voice cracked.
&quot;You may as well stop the charade.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Charade? That wasn't the game they'd been playing. He decided
to wait. The moment seemed part of a giant contest where none of the players
wore team colors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, old man, terribly sorry about that.&quot; This
time the voice was Alex's. &quot;It's been a trying night.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Novosty,&quot; he yelled back. &quot;I've got an
automatic too, chum. Touch one hair of her head and you're history. I swear to
God. Now let her go, and then we'll talk.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My friend, my friend, I'm not keeping her.&quot; The
hesitation in his voice belied his attempt at calm. &quot;You don't understand.
We have a problem here, very serious. And I am getting wet. Why don't you come
out and let's discuss it somewhere dry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No way. You and I have a little catching up to do. Let
her go. She's not part of it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah, but she is very much a part of it. Why do you think
I am here tonight, risking everything? I need you now, Michael, more than ever.
We are all in deep trouble because of her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Vance started to respond, he felt a glancing blow against
the side of his neck, powerful, numbing. Awkwardly he stumbled forward, cursing
his own stupidity. Of course! The man he'd wounded had merely disappeared into
the palace labyrinth. He'd been back there somewhere, waiting. Now they'd
guided him here with all the shouting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He felt the Baretta slip from his grasp as his head slammed
against the hard plaster of the fresco. His attacker was reaching for the gun,
hands slippery with blood. There was hot breath against his face, the gurgle of
labored breathing. It was a dying man with nothing to lose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Alex was shouting at Eva through the rain, telling her to
run for it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good, he thought, and turned to shove his fist into the face
of the figure struggling to turn the pistol on him. The weapon fired, a lethal
blast next to his ear, but the muzzle was still directed away. The round
glanced off the stone archway and ricocheted down the hallway. As their struggle
continued, he heard the sound of the Saab, its engine coughing to life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Too bad. I'll miss the ride back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With that he brought his knee against the assailant's groin,
shoving him against the wall. Even then, though, he still could not see the
face; it was darkened or swathed in a black cloth, he couldn't tell which.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Suddenly the passageway flared, and he looked up to see
Novosty, rain-soaked, holding his small Italian lighter. In his left hand. In
his right was the black metallic shape of the Uzi. Just then the attacker, drenched
in blood, finally wrenched away the Baretta and was turning, trying to speak.
Vance noticed, absently, that blood streamed from a gash across the side of his
neck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I am sorry, my friend.&quot; Alex was lifting his
weapon, calmly and with perfect precision. &quot;Things have become
complicated, but do not worry. I have handled it.&quot; And the Uzi erupted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The dying man actually managed to squeeze off a round, a shot
that went wild, as the impact of the Uzi slammed him against the wall. Then he
fired again, almost a death tremor, and pitched forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance started to stretch for the pistol as it clattered
across the floor toward him, but Novosty's voice sounded through the storm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, do us both a favor, just leave it. I've killed
enough men tonight. Three. And I knew them all. I am very weary of it, so
please . . .&quot; He was walking over, still holding the Uzi. &quot;Let's have
a drink and talk. This is very unsettling to my nerves.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You and your friends screwed up a perfectly fine evening.
You'd better have a good excuse.&quot; Vance watched him, very much wanting the
pistol in his hands. Should he make a grab for it and take his chances?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As I tried to tell you just now, it is very
complicated.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Novosty was
picking up the Baretta, grasping it carefully with a piece of wet cloth he'd
ripped from the dead man's shirt. Then he looked up. &quot;Are your prints on
this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sort of figures, doesn't it? I borrowed it from
him.&quot; He pointed down at the blood-soaked corpse between them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So we must clean it,&quot; he sighed. &quot;What
happened here tonight was a terrible accident, my friend. Obviously. How else
can it be explained? There will be an international inquiry. We must now try
and simplify the work of whoever has that unpleasant duty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You've got some explaining of your own to do. What
about Eva?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ah yes, Eva. She should have known better than to come
here.&quot; He looked up. &quot;Tonight simply need not have happened. It has
always distressed me, the imprudence of some women.&quot; He sighed again.
&quot;I do not know if I can cover up this affair. It may well be the end for
me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No kidding. Killing those two men out there may dampen
your welcome in these parts.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I regret to say it was necessary. They wanted to take
her. But when I reasoned against it, they became suspicious. Which is why I had
no choice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was Novosty here protecting Eva, he suddenly wondered? After
all, there was age-old blood connecting them; Eva Borodin and Alex Novosty went
back centuries together, centuries of Russian history. Aristocrats both, they
shared family, pain, and glory from an age long before the October Revolution.
But would she turn to him for refuge? No, not likely. She'd never be that
desperate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Like you said this morning, Alex, it's unhealthy in
this business to know too much. Tends to spoil all the interesting
surprises.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, I agree. Ignorance is often bliss, I think that's
the expression. But having solved one problem, I then faced another. What to do
about them? Happily our friend here was available to help. I honestly think he
would have died anyway from his neck wound.&quot; He glanced up. &quot;Did you
do this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Spur of the moment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You are still good, Michael.&quot; He bent over and
examined the severed artery again. &quot;My compliments. You haven't lost it.
An excellent job. I believe this incision would have been fatal.&quot; He
turned back and smiled. &quot;You have a surgeon's touch.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you going to tell me who the hell he is, or do we
play twenty questions?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He was . . . a professional acquaintance. This was most
regrettable. For everyone. Mine was a distasteful task, I assure you.&quot; He
sighed once more as he laid both weapons against the wall. &quot;I will trust
you, Michael. In turn you must trust me. And help me. We need to move this poor
unfortunate to a more plausible location.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance now realized what Novosty was planning. He was about to
pin the murder of the two outside on a dead man, this one. But who were they?
Whoever this one was, one of his hands only had three fingers; the little
finger had been cut away just below the knuckle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Forget it. I'm not going to help you do anything. I'm
going to walk out of here, try and find Eva, and get the hell away from all
this. You're a negative influence, Alex.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My friend, be reasonable.&quot; He pointed toward the
weapons. &quot;We have work to do. We must remove all the prints from those,
yours and mine, then create an accident.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, you broke up a small party I had going here
tonight. But now that you've ruined my evening, I damned sure don't plan to
help you clean up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, neither of us had anything to do with this
unfortunate business. You or me. I wasn't even in Greece. It must have been
some terrible misunderstanding among men of questionable livelihood. Tempers
obviously flared. Who knows? Everybody is dead, so there can be no explanation
beyond what appearances suggest.&quot; He shrugged and slipped his arms
underneath the body. &quot;Incidentally, they told me that Volodin was captured
this morning. But he didn't talk. Instead he killed himself. So our situation
is still secure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You must have a hearing problem. Maybe you ought to get
it checked. I just told you it's Eva I'm going to help, not you. You can take
the money and—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My friend, my friend, you are impetuous. Please. Everything
is going as planned. But now we must move quickly.&quot; He smiled. &quot;By
the way, did you leave anything down below?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just a broken bottle.&quot; Vance stared out into the
rain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then you might wish to make it disappear.&quot; He
began dragging the body into the courtyard. &quot;It will have prints. Glass
preserves them perfectly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He's right for once, Vance thought. Rubbing at his neck, a
glimmer of pain intruding, he turned and retraced his steps into the dark, into
the labyrinth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he descended, the chill of the palace enveloped him. He
was bored with the place now, its ancient horrors and its modern ones. When the
dark became too depressing, he extracted a folder of hotel matches and struck
one. Its puny light flared and then expired, almost helpless against the
blackness engulfing him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The sound of crickets followed as he entered the bedroom of
the queen once more. He paused a moment in the dark, then struck another match
and walked over to the stone bed. There was the neck of the splintered bottle,
covered with bloody fingerprints. Novosty was right about one thing: It would
have opened a whole new area of inquiry. Nobody at Interpol had his prints on
file, at least as far as he knew. But that wasn't good enough. Leave nothing to
chance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Carrying the fractured bottle, he began remounting the steps.
This time he wanted the dark, needed it, to clear his mind, to mask the horrors
of the palace. The confusion of the shootout swirled in his mind. Alex Novosty
had killed three men as calmly as lighting a cigarette. Why? Was it just for
the money?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When he emerged, distant lightning glinted on the ancient
stones of the courtyard, contrasting brightly with the darkness below. For an
instant the palace seemed magical all over again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And there, perfectly choreographed on the wet pavement, was
evidence of a lethal duel. Three bodies lay across from each other, two
together and one opposite, gripping a weapon, his neck slashed. Perhaps it
looked too pat, but who would know? Things happened that way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The only participant missing was Aleksei Ilyich Novosty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He gazed around, but he knew he would see nothing. Yes, Alex
had gotten out quickly and cleanly. He'd always been hit and run.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All right, Vance told himself, now it's time to answer a few
questions. Who the hell is looking for Eva, and who wants to silence her? Are
they the same people?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Carefully, methodically he began to search the pockets of the
two men Novosty had killed outside. He knew what he was looking for. The first
appeared to be in his fifties, pockmarked cheeks, looked very Russian in spite
of it all. He had a small Spanish Llama 9mm compact in a shoulder holster.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The other man was younger, though already balding. His cheeks
were drawn, and blood was already staining around the two holes in his cheap
polyester suit. His last expression was one of disbelief frozen in time. He's
the back-up, Vance told himself, number two. That's always how they work. He
should have stayed back home, maybe digging potatoes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The passports were Bulgarian, a forgery, stamped with a Greek
entry visa one week old. Port of entry: Athens. But they had to be KGB. No
wonder Novosty was in trouble now. He was playing both sides of the game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally he pulled around the head of the other man, the one
swathed in black, the one who had almost killed him twice. This was the one
he'd been saving till last, trying to guess.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A bloody, brutal face stared back at him, and through the
torn shirt he could see a garish tattoo covering the back and chest. At first
he couldn't believe it, so he lit a match and cupped it against the rain while
he ripped open the rest of the cloth to be sure. History swirled around him.</span></p>

color:windowtext'>Andrei Petrovich Androv, director of propulsion systems,
gazed out across the windy strait, feeling the chill of the sea air cut through
his fur-lined trench coat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Physically, he was almost mythic, a giant from Grimms' fairy
tales. He had a heavy face nature should wish on no man, tousled gray hair,
bushy eyebrows eternally cocked in skepticism, and a powerful taste for
Beethoven's string quartets, which he played incessantly in the instrument
room. He bore, in fact, more than a passing resemblance to that aging, half-mad
genius. Now seventy-one, he, too, possessed a monumental mind and was
acknowledged worldwide as the founding intellect behind the Soviet space
program.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, he was thinking, this location had been ideal. Here in
remote Hokkaido they had constructed a high-security facility surrounded by
wind-swept wilderness—virgin forests and snow-covered volcanoes. Even for him,
a man long used to the harsh winters of Baikonur, the almost Siberian weather
along this coast was intimidating. This was the most isolated, austere, and
yes, lonely spot he'd ever known.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But it was the perfect site. Mino Industries had insisted,
rightly, on this northernmost point of Japan for the facility, here in a
national park on Cape Soya, fifty kilometers west of Wakkanai. The facility
itself had been constructed entirely underground, excavated beneath this rocky
northern coast in order to be secure and invisible to satellite reconnaisance,
both Soviet and American. Such excessive precautions, hardly a problem in the
New Mexico desert when the first atomic bomb was tested, were the order of the
day in this new era of space photography. Nowadays you even had to find ways to
mask telltale waste heat</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>expulsion,
which always betrayed an unmistakable infrared signature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In that respect, too, their choice of this spot was strategic,
with the freezing currents of the La Perouse Strait between northern Hokkaido
and Sakhalin providing a continuous and thermally stable 12 degrees Celsius
feed for the heat exchangers. Only the ten-thousand-meter test runway could not
be concealed full-time, but it had been carefully camouflaged and was used only
at night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A massive breaker crashed against the rocks at the north end
of the shore, sending ice-flecked spray upward into the morning mist. As he
watched the freezing cloud and felt its ice collecting on his cheeks, he
glanced at his watch. It was seven-forty. He took one last survey of the choppy
gray sea and turned back. His daily morning walk down to the shore had achieved
its purpose: His mind was as sharp as the icy wind whistling through the rocks.
He needed to be at Number One by 0800 hours, when the final test run was
scheduled to begin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he did every morning, he retraced the concrete steps that
led down to the stainless steel entry door leading into the West Quadrant. When
he reached it, he inserted a coded plastic card into the slot, pronounced his
name into the black microphone flush with the metal doorframe, and signaled the
TV eye. Two seconds later a simulated voice from the computer granted him
access, the door sliding aside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He nodded to the guards, then moved on down the long
neon-lit, gray hallway. When he reached the unmarked door of Number One, he
paused to listen. The whine of the fans was still a high growl as the engineers
ran through the warm-up preparatory to bringing its six 25,000-horse- power
motors to full power. Contenting himself that vibration in the fan housings
remained at acceptable levels, he flashed his ID to the guard, inserted his
magnetic card, and shoved open the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without a word, he marched to his desk by the main video
panel and slipped a scratched old Melodiya disk onto his ancient turntable.
Moments later, the first movement of Beethoven's Quartet in A Minor boomed from
the speakers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We are ready to switch on the laser field, Doktor
Androv.&quot; A young Soviet technician approached gingerly. &quot;If you wish,
we can direct the holograms here to the master terminal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;More of your pretty pictures?&quot; He was examining
the data on the video screens. Then he nodded. &quot;<i>Da. Ya gotov</i>. When
you will.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he stared at the screens, he again found himself growing
pensive. The project was all but finished now. His lifelong dream.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He silently counted their breakthroughs. The new material
being used for the leading edges and scramjet struts, a proprietary titanium
alloy coated with a ceramic skin, had turned out to be much lighter than
aluminum and eight times as strong. Full-scale sections of the leading edges of
the wings and the engine struts had been subjected to ten- minute blasts of
3,500 degrees Fahrenheit air at Mach 7 in the high-temperature tunnel with no
deformation or structural failure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the turboramjet-scramjets, four meters in diameter and
nine meters long, had all been given full-scale static tests at the aeropropulsion
facility in the south, where they were operated to Mach 8 at temperatures
ranging from minus 100 to over 1900 degrees Fahrenheit. Massive refrigeration
units and gas heaters had been used to achieve the temperature range, while
liquefied air was pumped into the intakes to duplicate a complete hypersonic
duty cycle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe, he thought, they were ready for a full-scale test
flight. Only one problem remained: a hint of supersonic wave drag the
low-temperature helium wind tunnel had shown could develop behind the leading
edges. He had ordered the project director to run a computer simulation
examining the performance of two new ceramic spoilers, modified canard
foreplanes, and the preliminary results indicated the drag would be effectively
damped. Still, he was determined to test that design modification with a full
run-up here in Number One, the massive hypersonic tunnel that contained a
ten-meter scale model of the vehicle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he sat thinking, he neglected to acknowledge the arrival
of the project director, now advancing down the concrete steps that led from
the steel entry door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Dobriy utro</i>, Doktor Androv.&quot; Taro Ikeda's
good-morning greeting was heavily accented. &quot;<i>Kak pashaviatye</i>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Khoroshau</i>.&quot; Andrei Petrovich Androv nodded
absently, still engaged in his thoughts. &quot;<i>Dobriy utro</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Today I have more good news,&quot; Ikeda
continued as he headed for the coffee urn. &quot;My 0730 briefing included a
report that during the night our Tsukuba team completed a simulation of the
aerodynamic performance of your suggested modification all the way to Mach 25.
Just as you envisioned, leading-edge deformation and vortex bursts were reduced
to values well within the acceptable envelope.&quot; He looked back.
&quot;Which makes me question whether we really need to proceed with this
morning's run.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your SX-10 only tells us how a fuselage performs if
airflows are ideal,&quot; Androv replied. &quot;At hypersonic temperatures and
velocities air doesn't behave predictably, like a perfect gas. Fluid dynamics
models can only give us approximations of actual characteristics.&quot; He
glanced up from the video control panel, his face determined. &quot;It is my
son, Yuri, who will be in the cockpit of these vehicles, and my experience is
you never put your faith in simulations. In the hypersonic regime, computer
simulations are just guesswork, a shortcut not worth a <i>drozhky </i>driver's
fart.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;As you wish,&quot; Ikeda replied evenly,
taking his first sip of coffee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In truth, Andrei Androv did not dismiss simulations out of
hand. He knew their Fujitsu supercomputer was truly a marvel, capable of
replicating the aerodynamic characteristics of a given fuselage component,
modifying it, testing it, over and over millions of times, iterating to the
optimum design in almost the twinkling of an eye.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In every respect the high technology available here was
astonishing. Take their hypersonic wind tunnel. Its laser probes shone thin
slices of coherent light through the swirling air currents, revealing
complexities otherwise hidden amid whorls of turbulence. These data were then
enhanced through holography, which used the laser light to create colored 3-D
representations of the flow around the model. Finally those holograms were fed
into the supercomputer and analyzed from all angles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This project would have been impossible anywhere else on
earth. But here, the foreign team had created a feather-light hypersonic
airframe that used turbo-ramjets for horizontal takeoff and then changed their
geometry into fuel-injected supersonic combustion ramjets, or scramjets, which
combusted fuel and atmospheric oxygen using an internal shock wave instead of
conventional compressors to achieve orbital velocity, Mach 25. It was his dream
come true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Brief me again on the simulation.&quot; Androv turned
back to Ikeda. &quot;You say you went all the way to our maximum design
objective?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We ran through the entire flight profile in real
time,&quot; the other man replied. &quot;There were no stability problems
whatsoever. Either during the power-up or during the switch-over to scramjet
engine geometry at Mach 4.8.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Encouraging, encouraging.&quot; Androv turned back to
his video panel as the fans continued to accelerate. The violins of the A Minor
quartet, his favorite of all Beethoven's late works, washed over the room.
&quot;All the same, we must run a complete sequence here for any design
alterations.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He then fell silent, studying the screens. Mach 25. That
was—yes—almost seventeen thousand miles per hour. A velocity greater than any
existing missile. And it was air-breathing!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Their supercomputer's revolutionary aerodynamic design had
made it possible. Problem: at velocities higher than Mach 5 unprecedented
airflows were required, due to heat buildup in the fuel-injection struts and
the shortage of oxygen at rarified altitudes. Solution: the entire underside of
the vehicle had been shaped to serve as an extension of the intakes for the
twelve massive scramjets. The fuselage of the plane itself was going to act as
a giant funnel, scooping in air. And it had appeared to work, at least in the
computer. Then finally the Japanese engineers had perfected the
liquid-air-cycle process, permitting the cryogenic hydrogen fuel to be used to
liquefy a portion of the incoming air and inject it under high pressure into
the engine. The final, essential breakthrough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Andrei Androv was both an idealist and a pragmatist. In
Russia you had to be. That education began almost half a century earlier when,
as a student, he had been on hand to assist in the first free flight of a
Russian-made liquid fuel rocket, at an army base just outside Moscow. He had
experienced the exhilaration of a new frontier, and plunging himself into the
new science of rocketry, he had become a self-taught expert who published
theoretical works read and praised by men three times his age.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ironically, therefore, Andrei Petrovich Androv had not
enjoyed the luxury of being ignored, as the American rocket pioneer Goddard had
been. Joseph Stalin, always paranoid, decided that the rocket researchers'
&quot;fireworks&quot; were &quot;dangerous to the country.&quot; Consequently,
Andrei Petrovich Androv was arrested, interrogated at Butyrskaya Prison in
Moscow, and dispatched on the Trans-Siberian Railroad to a convict coal mine on
the Pacific coast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Eventually the political winds shifted. As a recognized
rocket expert, he was part of the 1946 Soviet team that shipped German
scientists and V-2 launchers back to Russia. Finally, under Khrushchev, he rose
to genuine prominence, since that general secretary believed that only rockets,
not manned aircraft, had the range to drop bombs on the U.S. Nikita S. Khrushchev
put Andrei Androv in charge of all Soviet rocketry, and Andrei Androv put Russia
in space.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd been in charge of constructing the sprawling Baikonur
Cosmodrome, near Tyuratram in Kazakhstan, central Asia, still the world's
largest space center. From it he orbited the world's first satellite, Sputnik,
and the world's first astronaut, Yuri Gagarin. He knew the byways of that
top-secret facility almost better than he knew his own living room—the gantry
systems, the fueling apparatus, the clean rooms, the rocket assembly areas, the
sectors where satellites were readied. Most recently, in 1987, he had been in
charge of the successful first test launch of the most powerful vehicle the
world had ever seen—the Energia, propelled by liquid hydrogen engines capable
of lifting a hundred-ton space platform into orbit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Also during that time his only son, Yuri Andreevich, had
become the Soviet Union's leading test pilot. Yuri was rarely home, and then,
nine years ago, Andrei Androv's wife had died of pneumonia. Isolated in the
long, snowy nights at Baikonur, he'd consoled himself with string quartets, his
studies of classical Greek, and his designs, his dreams of the ultimate space
vehicle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But he knew Russia would never be able to build it alone.
Soviet computer and materials technology already was slipping behind those of
the West.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He grimaced to think how his country had been brought to
today's humiliating state of affairs, reduced to bargaining with foreigners
like Arabs in a medina. Eventually, though, pragmatism had overruled all.
Underlying this bizarre new alliance was one simple reality: the USSR needed
Japanese high technology desperately. And it needed that technology now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It had begun two years earlier, when the president himself
had paid a surprise secret visit to the space complex at Baikonur, supposedly
to review the Energia launch schedule. That, however, was merely the official
excuse. He actually had an entirely different agenda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without saying why, he had invited his old friend Andrei
Petrovich Androv to join him at the secluded hunting lodge where he was
staying—to talk, one-on-one, about the future of Soviet science. As that long
snowy evening wore on, wind whistling through the log walls and pine smoke
clouding the air, their conversation had turned to hard truths and blunt
language.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In vino, Veritas. By midnight, the uniformed bodyguards
outside were stamping their heavy boots to keep warm, and Andrei Petrovich and
Mikhail Sergeevich were both drinking vodka directly from the bottle, had flung
its tinfoil cap onto the rough-hewn boards of the cabin's floor. By then, too,
the revered Andrei Petrovich Androv was boldly speaking his mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mikhail Sergeevich, time has run out for Russia. There
is nothing to buy, almost nothing to eat, and prices are soaring. There is so
much corruption you will not leave a Russian hospital alive unless you've
bribed everyone, right down to the drunken orderlies. And those bribes can't be
money. Who wants rubles? They are worthless. These days you have to bribe with
vodka.&quot; He'd laughed sadly, then picked up an old copy of Pravda there by
the fireplace, waved it in the air, and tossed it into the crackling flames.
&quot;When we start cooperatives, they are immediately taken over by our new
mafia, Russia's ruble millionaires. Everything—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Perestroika</i> will succeed in time, Andrei
Petrovich,&quot; the president had insisted perfunctorily, still not having
explained why they were meeting. &quot;We are moving as rapidly as
circumstances will permit. The bureaucracy—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Perestroika</i>!&quot; Androv had roared back.
&quot;Have you heard the latest joke from Moscow? <i>Perestroika</i> is like a
country where everyone is switching from driving on the left side to the right
side—gradually. Our half-measure concessions to a market economy have produced
the worst of both systems. We now have a land with socialist initiative and
capitalist conscience.&quot; He paused to laugh again, then sobered. &quot;And
soon, very soon, we're going to find ourselves in the technological Third
World. We need a vision. Even more, we need hard currency, and Western
technology now. And we need massive amounts. Nothing less can save us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when the president had nodded silently, then lifted
a top-secret document from his black leather briefcase. He explained that it
was a proposal from a consortium of foreigners. He wanted Andrei Androv's
honest assessment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Read this, Andrei Petrovich,&quot; he said, passing it
over, &quot;and tell me what you think. It may well be a terrible thing even to
consider, but I must know your view. You, my old friend, are one of the few men
I know I can trust. This proposal, can it work?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he squinted by the flickering light of the fire, Andrei
Petrovich Androv almost couldn't believe what he was reading. Among other
things, the dream he had dreamed so long was there, his for the taking. The
dream of a bold venture in space achieved with a whole new level of technology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Along with it, the Soviet Union would receive everything it
needed. The foreigners would provide billions and billions in long-term,
low-interest loans and a flood of subsidized consumer goods to erase the pain
of perestroika, providing the president with the badly needed financing, not to
mention popular support, he needed to bring it off. But there were price tags,
several of them. The first would be total access to all Soviet space and
propulsion technology. That component would actually make sense technically,
but the others were higher, much higher. Could it be done? Should it be done?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you think, Andrei Petrovich?&quot; the
president had finally spoken, his voice a whisper above the snap of embers and
the howl of wind. &quot;Do we dare?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room had fallen silent for a long moment. Was this some
kind of trap? he almost wondered, like the old days. No, he'd quickly
concluded, this time Russia was different. He would have to trust Mikhail
Sergeevich. Most of all, though, he was holding his life-long ambition in his
hand. At last he replied, hope mingled with apprehension.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think we have no choice.&quot; He had looked up at
the president's troubled eyes. &quot;You have no choice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Unfortunately, I think you are right.&quot; He had
sighed and turned his gaze to the blackness outside the snow- banked window.
&quot;<i>Ve tyomnuyu noch, ya znayu</i>. Yes, Andrei Petrovich. On this dark
night, I finally know what we must do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After one final vodka, they had set about devising the
scenario that would change the world forever. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The airflow around the model continued to accelerate, while
laser holograms of its complex aerodynamics were now being converted by the
computer into multi-colored graphic art. Androv watched the wall-size liquid
crystal display screen in the control room begin generating a vivid depiction
of the streams whirling past the model, simulating the incremental stages of
hypersonic climb. It was like watching a hallucination, he thought, as colors
swirled around the fuselage of an object seemingly composed of 3-D lines and
curves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We are now at Mach 6, Comrade Doktor Androv.&quot; The
voice of a Soviet technician interrupted his thoughts. &quot;The laser data show
that the supersonic wave drag peaks at Mach 3.8, then subsides. Your new canard
foreplanes appear to be working, at least for this portion of the flight
envelope.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Androv studied the screen, noncommittal. &quot;Thus far it
would appear to be so. Perhaps the SX-10 was correct. All the same, at Mach 7,
I want to switch on the enhancer, then capture those data and analyze them to
be doubly sure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The hypersonic enhancer permitted wind-tunnel burst tests at
far higher velocities than a conventional facility could achieve. More high
tech.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There could still be a problem,&quot; Androv continued,
&quot;when the vortex of air currents shed from the nose of the fuselage
encounters the shock waves from the wings, particularly around Mach 11.&quot;
He turned to Ikeda. &quot;Those vortexes have been responsible for significant
damage to several American space shuttles during reentry phase. I need to see
the data.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you wish.&quot; The director walked to the thick
glass window that looked out onto the model suspended in the airstream. The
crew of technicians hovered over the controls, watching for any signs of
vibration. He studied the screens for a few moments, then spoke quietly to the
head of the technical team, an intense young man in spectacles. This lieutenant
turned and passed the order to his colleagues, who nodded gravely and stationed
themselves at the switches.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Above the roar, a brilliant arc of electricity suddenly
exploded just in front of the nose of the model, adding an additional burst of
pressure at Mach 6 to the velocity already passing across. It was a blinding,
microsecond pulse that momentarily boosted simulated vehicle velocity to Mach
13. The lasers registered the data, then passed it directly, via microwave
link, into the memory banks of the powerful SX-10 operating hundreds of miles
away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Seconds later the turbulence data appeared in visual form on
the liquid crystal screen above them. As the colored numbers flashed, a cheer
went up from the normally somber technicians.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Still no sign of any wave drag outside the theoretical
envelope, not even at Mach 13,&quot; the young head-technician beamed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just as we simulated,&quot; Ikeda noted quietly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This time even the grave Androv smiled. &quot;I must congratulate
all of you.&quot; He was rising from his chair, the central one facing the main
controls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I will order the modification installed,&quot;
Ikeda nodded, &quot;if you formally authorize it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Authorized. I think you are right. Perhaps we are ready
for a hypersonic test flight.&quot; Androv reached to switch off his turntable.
&quot;I would like to go down to the hangar now myself, in fact. Perhaps
celebrate this moment with a glass of tea.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course.&quot; Ikeda spoke quickly to his Japanese
technicians, then followed the Russian out the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The hallways were a connected maze of brilliantly lighted and
scrupulously clean tunnels. They moved down the main corridor to the central
checkpoint, then turned and entered the South Quadrant, passing the various assembly
sections. Those sectors were mostly quiet now, since the final work had been
completed several weeks earlier.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Androv said nothing as they walked toward the doorways
connecting the South Quadrant with the underground hangar. He merely whistled a
portion of the third movement of the A Minor quartet, Beethoven's hymn of
thanksgiving in the Greek, Lydian mode. He recalled that the English writer
Aldous Huxley had once suggested that particular movement was proof of God's
existence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was there a God? He wasn't sure. The only miracles he knew of
on this earth were performed by men. He was on the verge of performing one
himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The history of space exploration had been played out entirely
in his lifetime. He himself had been the architect of much of that progress.
But putting a man into space remained an expensive and dangerous proposition.
Launch vehicles still exploded with alarming regularity. Man was trapped on
this planet. God was still in the heavens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Man's hope of reaching God at will required a special
creation, one that could taxi off a runway just like a normal aircraft, then
accelerate to hypersonic speeds, reaching low-earth orbit. An air-breathing
space vehicle. Its potential for the peaceful exploration of near-earth space
defied imagination.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Peace. All his life, Andrei Petrovich Androv had worked in
the shadow of war. Now, at last, he had created the ultimate symbol of peace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The entry to the hangar was secured, but when the guards saw
Dr. Androv and the project director approaching, they saluted and punched in
the codes on the locks. Moments later the heavy steel doors slid aside, revealing
the brilliant lights of the hangar. It was cavernous, over a hundred feet high,
with gantries now standing idle along the walls. White-coated technicians
swarmed over the two prototypes, checking the final seals, while others were on
twenty-foot-high trucks servicing the engines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Looming above them were what appeared to be two giant
prehistoric birds, streaks of gleaming silver over three hundred feet in
length, with pen-sharp noses that dipped rakishly downward. Androv paused to
admire them a moment, marveling in spite of himself. The long, sleek lines
swept back in a clean curve, without the interruption of a windshield. The
&quot;cockpit,&quot; in fact, was deep inside the nose, where shock waves would
not impact the computer guidance system. From the nose its lines burgeoned into
a sharp, clean fan, and beneath the two abbreviated wings were suspended twelve
massive turboramjet-scramjets. They had already been certified at Mach 4.5. In
ten days one of these vehicles would achieve the ultimate. Mach 25, seventeen
thousand miles per hour.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Americans had code-named their fledgling design</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>for a
hypersonic space plane—still at least a decade away— the X-30. But no such
mundane designation would satisfy Andrei Petrovich Androv, devoted disciple of
the ancients. He had long believed the Americans were high-tech vulgarians with
no poetry in their soul, no sense of history.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Across the towering tail assembly of both aircraft was an
insignia that symbolized the joining of two of the world's great superpowers, a
double ax. And along their titanium-composite fuselage was lettered a single
word, in Cyrillic characters. Andrei Androv had insisted on that name, in
celebration of the first human ever to soar above the earth, the dream of
ancient man. Now, he had declared, four thousand years later, there was another
dream, his dream, a hypersonic vehicle that could loft man directly into space
from anywhere on the planet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had dreamed that dream. And the Mino Industries Group had
permitted him to pick the name for the creation that would realize it, for the
miracle that would master time and space, the earth itself . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yuri Androv stood at the far end of the flood-lit hangar,
staring up at the underbelly of <i>Daedalus I </i>and thinking. This morning's
run-up in the centrifuge had gone well. At last he was convinced there was no
physiological barrier to hypersonic flight, at least none he couldn't handle.
The scramjets had all been put through their paces at the aero-propulsion
facility. On the test stand, at least, they met their specifications.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, he was thinking, this plane just might do it. He would
ease through the Mach 4.8 barrier slowly, then convert to scramjet geometry,
switch to liquid hydrogen, and go full throttle. It was scary, sure, but you
only lived once. Fuck the danger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The prospect was exhilarating and chilling. He looked up,
again awed. Even for someone who'd seen and flown them all, this was an
inspiring creation. Not only was it easily the most technologically advanced
flight vehicle in the world, it also was stunningly beautiful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Right now, however, there were two simple problems: first,
without a hypersonic test flight nobody could really be sure it would do what
it was supposed to; second, as of now both prototypes still belonged to Mino
Industries and would continue to belong to Mino Industries until the final
treaty and agreement were signed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Actually, taking the <i>Daedalus</i> hypersonic might be the
least of the project's worries. That was the part he knew how to handle. The unknowns
lay in another direction entirely, the strategic direction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Strategically, he still didn't trust Russia's new partner.
From what he'd heard, the conditions demanded in return for all their high
technology had been heavy, and that was just the short-term price. The
long-term cost might be even greater. Was the Soviet Union about to become the
financial and technological captive of a shadowy group of foreigners, men whose
identities remained, even now, shrouded in secrecy? Was this a Faustian bargain?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just then he noticed the doors at the far end of the hangar
slide open and two men in white lab coats enter. Perfect timing, he thought.
Even at that distance he knew immediately who they were: the joint venture's
two top technical officers: his father, Andrei Petrovich Androv, and Taro
Ikeda, the project director for the Japanese team. The men held equal
authority. Supposedly. But in fact all the real decisions on this project were
being made by somebody else entirely. The shots were actually being called from
a skyscraper in Tokyo, by a mysterious CEO known as Tanzan Mino.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Ikeda and the elder Androv were headed his way. As he
watched Ikeda, he felt himself involuntarily stiffen. Perhaps his unease about
the man was his intuitive, right brain working, trying to tell him something.
But what? All communications with the CEO were channeled through Ikeda. Fair
enough, he told himself, he was accustomed to secrecy. Maybe Japanese
industrialists were as careful about protecting their asses as the Soviet <i>nomenklatura
</i>were. Maybe it was just part of the landscape here too. But still . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Strastvitya</i>, Yuri Andreevich.&quot; Ikeda
smiled, extending his pale hand as he simultaneously bowed. &quot;<i>Kak
pashaviatye</i>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Khoroshau. Spahcebo</i>.&quot; He shook Ikeda's
hand, then nodded toward his father. &quot;If this is a good time, I'd like to
discuss the scramjet power-up sequence with Dr. Androv for a few moments.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If it's anything serious, then perhaps we should all
confer with the prime contractors,&quot; Ikeda responded smoothly. &quot;Right
now, in my office. In fact, I was just on the phone with—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No need to bring them in. Just a few technical items,
nothing more.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yuri Andreevich.&quot; Ikeda smiled and bowed again,
his eyes trying to display a warmth they clearly did not possess. &quot;Every
issue here is of importance to us all. If—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not every nut and bolt,&quot; he interrupted. &quot;I
just have some sequencing questions, that's all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ikeda bowed once more, quickly. &quot;You know we are all
depending on you. No one in Japan has the experience to take up a plane like
this. At least not at this stage of the project. So be aware that any matter
weighing upon the success of your test flight, or your safety—&quot; he flashed
another quick, concerned smile &quot;—is naturally of gravest concern to me,
and to the CEO.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then you should be glad to hear the power-up simulation
in the centrifuge this morning took me right through Mach 9.8 with no problems.
Which means the scramjet ignition sequence looks like a go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Congratulations.&quot; Ikeda nodded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;One last thing. I'll be sending a memo to Engineering
about a modification of the cockpit, to permit more latitude in the seat.
Nothing major. I think we could still reduce vascular stress in the high-G
regime.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Andrei Androv noticed the look of concern on his son's face.
&quot;Yuri, you seem troubled. This morning, did anything—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course, send Engineering your memo by all
means,&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Ikeda
interjected. &quot;I'll personally see it's taken care of. We want nothing to
go wrong. Not even the smallest—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good. That's all I want.&quot; Yuri turned and wrapped
his arm around his father's aging shoulders, gently urging him in the direction
of the trucks stationed beneath the silver nose of Daedalus I. He wanted to get
rid of Ikeda so he could talk. After they moved a few feet, he yelled back over
his shoulder. &quot;But wait on the decision till you read my memo.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you wish.&quot; Ikeda nodded farewell. &quot;I'll be
in my office until 1300 hours if we need contractor input.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which meant, Yuri knew, that no further communication with
him was permissible after that time. Technical consultations were only held
during mornings. Afternoons he seemed to have other pressing matters to attend
to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yuri, the run-up in Number One went well this morning.
I think we've finally eliminated the supersonic wave drag.&quot; The elder
Androv was heading over to check the hydraulic lifts supporting the landing
gear and its heavy 22-ply retractable tires. Then he glanced back and smiled.
&quot;I'm beginning to believe in miracles. We might just succeed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If those damned scramjets up there,&quot; he pointed
skyward, &quot;actually achieve ignition when they're supposed to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've studied the static-test data carefully. At the
propulsion facility they routinely achieved ignition at Mach 4.8. The numbers
were there and they looked all right. Temperature regime, pounds thrust, all
the rest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What's really happening, Yuri thought suddenly, is they've
taken our engineering design and built it. But what if we're just being used
somehow, having our brains picked, our expertise stolen? Then what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He said nothing, though, just listened quietly as the older
man continued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Also, the new ceramic composite they've come up with
for the fuel injection struts was heated to thirty-five hundred degrees
Fahrenheit and repeatedly stress-tested. Those data were particularly impressive.
You know, the struts have always been the Achilles heel for a scramjet, since
the fuel has to be injected directly through them into the combustion chamber.
They have to withstand shock waves, and thermal stresses, far beyond anything
ever encountered in a conventional engine. Nobody else has ever come up with a
material that can do it. Not us, not the Americans, not anybody. But now, their
high-temperature materials and liquid air cycle have finally made the scramjet
concept a reality. The last roadblock is gone.&quot; He looked up, still
marveling. &quot;All we or the Americans can do is make engineering drawings of
those engines, just pictures.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I hope you're right. But when we switch over from JP-7
to liquid hydrogen, nobody knows what can happen. It's never been done
before.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you really worried?&quot; The old man studied him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Damned right I am. Who wouldn't be?&quot; He looked
around at the milling Japanese technicians, then lowered his voice. &quot;And
I'll tell you something else. There're other things around here worrying me
too, maybe even more. Something about this project is starting to feel
wrong.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Andrei stared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm beginning to suspect ... I don't know. So far it's
just a sense, but—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yuri, let me tell you a hard fact,&quot; the elder Androv
interjected. &quot;Like it or not, this project is the only chance the Soviet
Union has to ever own a vehicle like this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That may be true, but if we—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Remember the sad fate of the TU-144,&quot; he went on,
&quot;the supersonic passenger plane we built based on some engineering
drawings for the Concorde we managed to get hold of. We copied it, but we got
it wrong, and in 1973 we had that horrible tragedy at the Paris Air Show, when
it crashed in a ball of fire. That was the end of it. We failed, and it was
humiliating. The Soviet Union couldn't even build a supersonic passenger jet.
The real truth is, we didn't have the computers we needed to design it.&quot;
He looked up, smiling. &quot;But now, all that humiliation will be
undone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yuri suddenly realized his father was being swept up in his
dreams. The same way he sometimes got lost in those damned string quartets, or
reading Euripides in the original Greek. He was going off in his fantasy world
again. He couldn't see that maybe he was being used.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have you ever wondered where this project is going to
lead? Where it has to lead?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It will lead the way to peace. It will be a symbol of
cooperation between two great nations, demonstrating that the human spirit can
triumph.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Moi otyets</i>, it could just as well 'lead the way'
to something else entirely. Don't you realize what's happening here? We're
giving away our thruster engineering, Russia's leading technology. It's the one
area where we still lead the world. We've just handed it over . . . for the
price of one fucking airplane. And even if we eventually get our hands on these
prototypes, we can't build more without begging the materials from them. We
can't fabricate these composite alloys in the Soviet Union.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But this is a joint venture. Everything will be
shared.&quot; He smiled again, his face gnome-like beneath his mane of white
hair. &quot;It will also give us both a chance to overcome the lead of Europe
and America in commercial passenger transport in the next century. That's what
this is all about. The future of nonmilitary aviation, it's right here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you really believe that?&quot; He stifled a snort of
incredulity. &quot;Don't you see what this vehicle really is? Let me tell you.
It's the most deadly weapons delivery system the world has ever seen. And we're
showing them how to build it, even testing it for them to make sure it'll
perform.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Daedalus will never be a military plane. I would
never have participated if I thought—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Exactly. That's what they want us to believe. But it
sure as hell could be. And Mino Industries will be the only company on earth
that can actually build more of them.&quot; He sensed it was useless to argue
further. Nothing mattered to Andrei Petrovich Androv except what he wanted to
believe. At this point, nothing could be done to expose the dangers, because
nobody on the Soviet team would listen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or maybe there was something. Why not make a small revision
in the test flight? Once he was aloft, what was anybody going to do? He would
be up there, alone. If he could get around their flight computer, he might just
show the world a thing or two. He'd been thinking about it for weeks now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right.&quot; He turned back. &quot;If this thing is
supposedly ready to fly, then I'll fly it. But get ready for some surprises.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yuri, what are you planning?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just a small unscheduled maneuver.&quot; The hell with
it, he thought. &quot;They've got seven days, and then I take it up . . . and
power-in the scramjets. I'm ready to go. Tell Ikeda to prepare to have liquid
hydrogen pumped into the tanks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But that's not how we've structured the test
schedule.&quot; Andrei examined him, startled. Yuri had always been fiery, but
never irrational. &quot;We need ten—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Fuck the schedule. I'm going to take this vehicle hypersonic
in a week, or they can get themselves another test pilot.&quot; He turned away.
&quot;Reschedule, or forget it. We don't have much time left. Once all the
agreements are signed—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yuri, I don't like this.&quot; His eyes were grave.
&quot;It's not—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just tell them to get <i>Daedalus I</i> prepped. I
think these bastards that call themselves Mino Industries have a whole agenda
they're not telling us about. But I'm about to rearrange their timetable.&quot;</span></p>

Zeno Stantopoulos's darkened <i>kafeneion</i>. He'd walked the lonely back road
into Iraklion in the dark, guiding himself by the rain-battered groves of plane
trees, olive, and wild pear, trying to figure out what in hell was happening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>To begin with, members of the intelligence services of major
nations didn't go around knocking each other off; that was an unwritten rule
among spooks. Very bad taste. Maybe you tried to get somebody to talk with
sodium pentathol or scopolamine, but guns were stupid and everybody knew it.
You could get killed with one of those things, for godsake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So this operation, whatever it was, was outside the system.
Good. That was the way he had long since learned to work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a lot on his mind, and the walk, the isolation,
gave him a chance to think over some of the past. In particular, the austere Cretan
countryside brought to mind an evening five years ago when he'd traveled this
little-used route with his father, Michael Vance, Sr. That occasion, autumn
brisk with a first glimmering of starlight, they'd laughed and joked for much
of the way, the old man occasionally tapping the packed earth sharply with his
cane, almost as though he wanted to establish final authority over the island
and make it his, once and for all. Finally, the conversation turned serious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, don't tell me you never miss academic
life,&quot; his father had finally brought himself to say, masking the remark
by casually brushing aside yet another pale stone with his cane. &quot;More and

famous all over again. It's an enviable position.&quot;</span></p>

yours, but you know I'll be retiring from Penn at the end of this term.
Naturally there'll be some vicious in-house jockeying to fill my shoes, but if
you'd like, I could probably arrange things with the search committee.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vindicated at last, he'd realized. It seemed the only sin in
academia greater than being wrong was being right too soon. But the
small-minded universe of departmental politics was the last thing he wanted in
his life. These days he played in the big time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm afraid I'll have to pass.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I suppose university life is too limiting for you
now,&quot; the old man had finally said, grudgingly but admiringly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd said that, and nothing more. Two months later he'd had a
second stroke and retired permanently. These days he grew orchids in Darien,
Connecticut, and penned impassioned longhand letters to the Times every day or
so, just to keep his capacity for moral outrage honed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance had definitely gone his own way. First he'd published a
book that rocked the scholarly world; then he'd compounded that offense by
walking out on the brouhaha that followed and going free-lance, starting his
own business. Next he'd become involved with the Washington intelligence
community, and finally he'd begun working with the Association of Retired
Mercenaries. It was a universe so alien to his father it might as well have been
on Mars. But if the old man was disappointed that Michael Vance, Jr., hadn't
turned out the way he'd planned, he still took pride in his son.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now, though, Stuttgart and the restoration of Phaistos would
have to be put on hold till the latest game with Novosty was sorted out. The
protocol. It was still running through his mind. Could there be some sort of
alliance cooking between the Soviets and the Japanese mob? What in hell . . . ?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, she is here.&quot; A hoarse whisper emerged as
the rickety wooden door of the <i>kafeneion</i>  edged open. Zeno tugged down
his nightshirt and carefully edged it wider, squinting out at the street.
&quot;Come in. Quickly. Before you are seen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So his guess had been right: she was avoiding the hotel. Good
move. Smart and typical of Eva. She was handling this one exactly right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stepped through the door. &quot;Where is she now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She's in back. Adriana gave her something to make her
sleep.&quot; Zeno was pulling out a chair from one of the empty tables. The
room was shrouded in darkness, and the stale odor of the kitchen permeated the
air. &quot;She was not herself, Michael. What happened? She claimed someone was
trying to murder her. At the palace. Did you two—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We tried throwing a party, but it started getting
crowded.&quot; He looked around. &quot;I could use some of that <i>raki </i>of
yours. I just had a close encounter with a guy you wouldn't sit down next to on
a bus. He refused to leave politely so . . . I had to make him disappear. Bad
scene.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You killed him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He was shooting, at Eva and me. Very unsociable.&quot;
He glanced toward the back of the darkened room. &quot;Zeno, our party guest
tonight was—you're not going to believe this— a Japanese hood. Tell me
something. Is the Yakuza trying to get a foothold in Crete? You know, maybe
buying up property? That's their usual style. It's more or less how they first
moved in on Hawaii.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, this country is so poor, there's nothing here
for gangsters to steal.&quot; He laughed. &quot;Let me tell you a secret. If a
stranger came around here and tried to muscle me, or any of my friends, he
would not live to see the sun tomorrow. Even the Sicilian Cosa Nostra is afraid
of us. Crete is still a small village in many ways, in spite of the crazy
tourists. We tolerate strangers, even open our homes to them if they are well
behaved, but we know each other's secrets like a family. So, to answer your
question, the idea of a Japanese syndicate coming here is impossible to imagine.
You know that as well as I do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's what I thought. But I saw a <i>kobun </i>from
the biggest Yakuza organization in Japan tonight. I know because I had a little
tango with their godfather a few years back. Anyway, what's one of his street
men doing here, shooting at Eva and me?&quot; He paused as the implications of
the night began to sink in. &quot;This scene could start to get rough.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You did nothing more than anybody here would have
done.&quot; He looked pensive in the dim light. &quot;Years ago, when the
colonels and their junta seized Greece, I once had to—&quot; He hesitated.
&quot;Sometimes we do things we don't like to talk about afterwards. But you
always remember the eyes of a man you must kill. You dream about them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Our party lighting was pretty minimal. It was too dark
to make out his eyes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then you are luckier than you know.&quot; He glanced
away. &quot;This was not somebody you knew from another job, Michael? Perhaps
the mercenary group you sometimes—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Never saw the guy before in my life, swear to God.
Anyway, I think it was Eva he really wanted. But whatever's going on, I have to
get her out of Crete now, before whoever it is finds her again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I agree.&quot; He was turning toward the living
quarters in the rear. &quot;You should stay here tonight, and then tomorrow we
can get you both passage on the car ferry to Athens, off the island. I will
take care of everything. Tickets, all of it.&quot; He returned carrying two
tumblers of <i>raki</i>. After setting them on the table, he continued. &quot;I
am very worried for her, Michael. And for you. We all make enemies, but—&quot;
He took a sip from his glass. &quot;By the way, do you have a pistol?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not with me.&quot; He reached for the glass, wishing it
was tequila—straight, with a twist of lime—and he was back on the Ulysses,
trimming the genoa. &quot;That's a mistake I may not make again soon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I will arrange for one. Like I said, everything. I
have many friends. Do not worry.&quot; He drank again. &quot;By the way, she
asked me go to the hotel and get something for you. She seemed to think it was
important. One of your modern American inventions. She had it locked in the
safe at the desk. And she gave me money to pay for her room.&quot; He sighed.
&quot;Why would she waste money on a hotel when she could have stayed here with
us?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What is it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think it's a computer, though it's barely the size of
a briefcase. Part of the new age that mercifully has passed us by. I have it in
back, with the rest of her things.&quot; His voice disappeared into the
darkened kitchen. Moments later he reappeared carrying Eva's laptop. With a
worried look he settled it gingerly on the table. &quot;Do you have any idea
why she had this with her?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think she may have something stored in here.&quot; He
settled it on the table and flipped up the top. Then he felt along the side for
the switch, and a second later the screen glowed blue. After the operating
system was in place, he punched up the files.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A long line of names filled the screen, arranged
alphabetically. But nothing seemed right. It was a stream of unclassified NSA
memos, and then a lot of personal letters. He resisted the temptation to call
them up and delve into her private life. How many men . . . ?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stick to business. Save the fun for later. Where's the file?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he noticed the very first alphanumeric.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ackerman.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hold on, he thought, wasn't that the name of the NSA guy she
said gave her the disk? He highlighted the file on the screen and hit Retrieve.
An instant later it appeared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yep, this one had to be it. Clearly an NSA document, very
carefully stored.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was it. The stream of numbers filled three pages, and
then came Article II. Thus it went, for ten articles. As he scrolled up page
after page, he realized that the numbers continued for the rest of the
document.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was right. Outside of occasional repetitions, there
seemed to be no real pattern. He'd seen a lot of encryptions in the old days,
but this one didn't look like anything standard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He sat staring at the screen. Mino Industries Group. That
explained the <i>Mino-gumi </i>goon. The godfather was planning his biggest
play yet, global.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But what was it? What was in the deal? This was something he
had to see.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Eva had said she tried the Data Encryption Standard, the DES
system, and got nowhere. Which meant NSA had been foiled. How had he done it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>DES was a procedure whereby data were passed through a series
of eight S-boxes, actually mathematical operations, that when combined with a
unique user key converted it into what appeared to be alphanumeric garbage. The
receiver also had a copy of the key, which could be used in combination with
the same set of mathematical operations to convert it back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He knew that back when DES was being invented by IBM, the
National Security Agency had purposely sabotaged Big Blue's original plan to
make it uncrackable. NSA had insisted that the key, a string of zeroes and
ones, be limited to 56 bits, rather than the proposed 128 bits, which would
have made the system so complex it would have been safe forever. The reason, of
course, was that NSA didn't want an unbreakable cipher loose on the planet;
after all, their primary business was reading other people's mail. IBM didn't
know it at the time, but the smaller key was already a pushover for NSA's Cray
supercomputers, which could try a trillion random keys per second and routinely
crack any 56-bit DES encryption in the world in half a day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Anybody familiar with the intelligence business was well
aware of that. Which was, obviously, why somebody had turned to NSA.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But Eva said she'd tried the usual random-key procedure and
got nowhere. So what was the answer?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His head was buzzing from the raki now, but he kept turning
over in his mind the possibility that she'd been looking in the wrong place.
Trying to find the DES key when in fact this encryption used some entirely
different scheme.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He rubbed at his temples and tried to run the scenario
backward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Project Daedalus</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. The more he thought about it, the more . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Zeno.&quot; He looked up from the screen.
&quot;Do you still have that copy of Realm of the Spirit?&quot; He'd sent the
old Greek an autographed first edition the week it came out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your book, Michael? Of course I have it. I treasure it.
It's in the bedroom, in back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mind getting it for me? I feel like a little light reading.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know how it is when your mind gets filled up with
garbage at bedtime.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You should be getting some sleep, like Eva. Tomorrow we
have to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I need to relax a little first. And I need that book.
There's a chart in the appendix guaranteed to put anybody to sleep.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very well.&quot; He sighed, drank off the last of his <i>raki</i>,
and pulled himself erect. &quot;Sometimes you can be as headstrong as your
father.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As quiet settled over the room, Vance continued to stare at
the screen. Why did he have a hunch he was right on this one? Could he really
crack a cypher with a 486 portable when NSA's Cray supercomputers had bombed?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe. Stranger things had happened. The samurai swordsmen
said you needed to know your opponent's mind. Here, in the waning hours before
dawn in the middle of Crete, he was feeling a curious oneness with whoever had
devised this random-looking string of numbers. He'd created number strings just
like this himself, back before the CIA had come into his life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Here it is, Michael. Adriana said Eva is still asleep.
I don't know what she gave her, perhaps one of her old wives potions.&quot; He
chuckled quietly. &quot;That's one of the reasons I love her so much. When you
get ancient like I am, it's good to be married to a nurse.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance took the book and, in spite of himself, weighed it in
his hand. What was it? maybe two pounds? The glistening dust jacket, unusual
for a university book back in those days, was still pristine. He smiled,
realizing it was unread.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thanks.&quot; He finally remembered Zeno. &quot;This
should do the trick. Now why don't you go on to bed? I'll just stretch out here
on a table when I get sleepy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, sometimes I think you are a madman.&quot; He
shrugged, then turned to hobble back toward the bedroom. &quot;Just don't
answer the door, whatever you do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Get some sleep. I'll be doing the same.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then good night. May God give you rest.&quot; He was
gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance barely nodded, since he was already turning to the
appendix of the book and switching on the dim overhead light. The volume
brought back a world long lost for him. Now he wanted it back, if only for a
moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

The setup was simple, but the next part would need some programming. The
numbers in the protocol had to be converted to sounds. It looked easy, but what
if they'd been deliberately garbled somehow? He'd be no better off than before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Think positive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he finished coding in the grid, he could hear the
tentative stirrings of early morning Iraklion outside. Trucks were starting up,
birds coming alive. He began noticing the lack of sleep, but he pushed it aside
and took another sip of <i>raki</i>. Just keep going, he told himself. You're
about to find out if great minds really do think alike. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Darling, what in the world are you doing with my
computer?&quot; The voice was like a whisper over his shoulder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How about checking to see if you've got any video
games?&quot; He turned around, startled in spite of himself. What had woken
her? She was probably wired. &quot;Eva, why did you take off tonight? And what
was that nonsense you were yelling at me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe it wasn't nonsense. Alex said you were working
for him. He said you two were partners. It's not really true, is it?&quot; She
slumped into a chair. She was wearing a light dressing gown, her hair tousled.
With a groan she rubbed at her eyes. &quot;I don't need this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You can forget about Alex. He's playing way over his
head. It's always bad judgment to underestimate the other team's
strengths.&quot; He reached for her. &quot;You've just got to decide who you
trust. You might start with Zeno. He's offered to help me get you out of
Crete.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And go where?&quot; She moved against him.
&quot;Michael, they found me here. They'll find me anywhere.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not if we turn this scene around and take the action to
them. But that's the next move. Right now, you just have to be out of Crete
while I do a little checking. How about flying to Miami, grabbing a plane down
to Nassau, then—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're going to get me on the Ulysses or die trying,
aren't you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He decided to let the crack pass. It was true, however. If
she ever saw it, he was sure she'd start to understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know,&quot; she went on, &quot;this afternoon I was
merely worried. Now I'm actually frightened. Guess I'm not as brave as I
thought. I'm sorry about tonight, running off like that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not the first time I've had a woman give me the
gate.&quot; He laughed, then reached out and stroked her hair, missing the long
tresses of the old days. &quot;Now, you can help me out with something. Does
the name Yakuza mean anything to you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; She studied him, puzzled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I probably shouldn't tell you this, maybe it'll just
upset your morning, but that wiseguy who broke up our party last night was a
Japanese hood. From the <i>Mino-gumi</i> syndicate. Back home they're Numero
Uno. They run Tokyo and Osaka and they've got half the Liberal Democratic Party
in their pocket. Then there's the old CIA connection, from days gone by.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How do you know?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;After you took off, our friend dropped in again. Uninvited
as usual. That's when Novosty finished him off with his Uzi and I got a closer
look.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alex killed—! My God, that makes three.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By actual count. He's gone a little trigger happy in
his old age. That or he's very, very scared.&quot; He rubbed at the scratch on
his neck, remembering. &quot;What if it's the Japanese mob that's behind this?
They have the funding, that's for sure. Among other things, they run consumer
loans in Japan, legalized loan sharking. They've got more money than God.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is too much. I don't know anything about . .
.&quot; She rose, trembling. &quot;I'll go with you to Nassau, Michael. Let's
take the Ulysses and just disappear in the middle of the Atlantic.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's a deal.&quot; He beamed. &quot;But first we've got
to answer some questions. You say the Yakuza are not part of anything you know
about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm only vaguely aware they exist.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And you don't know who runs Mino Industries?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Never heard of it before.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's a bunch of nice, clean-cut mobsters. Problem is,
one of the owner's <i>kobun</i>, street men, tried to kill us tonight. Maybe
we're finally getting a little light at the end of the tunnel.&quot; He looked
her over. Eva was always beautiful in the mornings. There was something wanton
about her this time of day. &quot;Come here a minute.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He took her and cradled her in his arms, then brushed his
lips against her brow. &quot;You okay?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think so.&quot; She took a deep breath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Never knew you to quit just because things got
tough.&quot; He drew her around. &quot;You're the cryptography expert. Why
don't we try to find out what kind of phonetics Ventris's numerical correlates
for Linear B would produce from these numbers?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; She rubbed at her
eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, in my travels I've discovered something. A
great mind often has a touch of poetry. Sometimes, in order to think like the
other guy, you need to be a little artistic. So, I wonder . . . about that
cipher.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just a crazy, early morning idea.&quot; He patted the
keyboard of the laptop. &quot;What if the mind behind it is using a system no
computer in the world would ever have heard of?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's no such thing, believe me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe yes, maybe no.&quot; He flipped open his book to
the central section, a glossy portfolio of photos. He'd shot them himself with an
old Nikon. &quot;Take a look at this and refresh your memory.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>She looked down at the photo of a large Minoan clay
jar from the palace, a giant <i>pithoi</i>, once a container for oil or
unguents or water for the bath. Along the sides were inscribed rows of wavy lines
and symbols. It was the Minoan written language, which, along with cuneiform
and hieroglyphics, was among the oldest in the world. &quot;You mean Linear
B.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Language of King Minos. As you undoubtedly remember,
it's actually a syllabary, and a damned good one. Each of these little pictures
is a syllable, a consonant followed by a vowel. Come on, this was your thing,
way back when. Look, this wavy flag here reads mi, and here, this little
pitchfork with a tail reads no.&quot; He glanced up. &quot;Anyway, surely you recall
that Linear B has almost a hundred of these syllable signs. But Ventris
assigned them numbers since they're so hard to reproduce in typeface. For example,
this series here, <i>mi-no-ta-ro</i> reads numerically as—&quot; he checked the
appendix, &quot;13-52-59-02. Run them together and <i>minotaro</i> reads
13525902. And just like the early Greeks, the Minoans didn't insert a space
between words. If somebody was using Linear B, via Ventris' system, the thing
would come out looking like an unintelligible string of numbers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You don't really—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You say you've tried everything else. NSA's Crays drew
a blank. Maybe you were looking for some fancy new encryption system when it
was actually one so old nobody would ever think of it. Almost four thousand
years old, to be exact.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Darling, that's very romantic. You're improving in the
romance department.&quot; She gazed at him a second, then flashed a wry smile.
&quot;But I can't say the same for the good-sense arena. No offense, but that's
like the kind of thing kids write to us suggesting. Nobody employs anything remotely
that simple these days.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I knew you'd think I was crazy. You're not the
first.&quot; He rose. &quot;But humor me. Just slice those number sequences
into pairs and see what they look like phonetically. Something to take your mind
off all the madness around here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, all right.&quot; She sighed, then settled
unsteadily into the rickety chair he'd just vacated. &quot;Make you a proposition,
sweetie. Get me some coffee, nice and strong, and I'll forget I have good sense
and play with this a little.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're a trooper.&quot; He turned and headed for the
kitchen. &quot;I remember that about you. Not to mention great in bed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We strive for excellence in all things.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just as he reached the doorway, the kitchen light flicked on.
It was Adriana, in blue robe and furry slippers, now reaching up to retrieve
her coffee pan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While Eva was typing away behind him, he leaned against the
doorframe in his still-wet clothes to watch a Greek grandmother shuffle about
her private domain preparing a traditional breakfast. He suspected no male hand
had ever touched those sparkling utensils. The Old World had its ways,
yesterday and forever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While he drowsed against the doorjamb, the aroma of fresh
Greek coffee began filling the room. <i>Sarakin</i>. That was the Japanese name
for their homegrown loan sharks, the so-called salary-men financiers. He knew
that the Yakuza's four largest <i>sarakin</i> operations gave out more consumer
loans than all of Japan's banks combined. If you added to that the profits in
illegal amphetamines, prostitution, bars, shakedowns of businesses, protection
rackets . . . the usual list, and you were talking multi multibillions. The
major problem was washing all that dirty money. They routinely invested in
respectable but losing propositions abroad, on the sound theory that one dollar
cleaned was worth two unlaundered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was that what the Soviet scam was all about? Money from the
Japanese mob being laundered through loans to the USSR? What better way to wash
it? Nobody would ever bother asking where it came from.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But there was one major problem with that neat scenario.
Politically the Yakuza were ultra-rightist hardliners. So why would they expose
their money with the Soviets, laundered or not? Particularly now, with so much
political instability there—hardliners, reformers, nationalists. Somehow it
didn't compute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, come here a second.&quot; The voice had an
edge of triumph.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?&quot; He glanced around groggily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just come here and take a look at this.&quot; She was
staring at the screen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned and walked over, still entranced by the heady,
pungent essence of fresh Greek coffee now flooding the room. &quot;Is it
anything—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just look at it and tell me what you think.&quot; She
leaned back from the screen and shifted the Zenith toward him. The ice-blue
letters cast an eerie glow through the dull morning light. The color reflected
off his eyes, matching them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You did it already?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I started with a one-to-one replacement of numbers with
letters. But it's sequence-inverted, which means I had to . . . anyway, what do
think so far? Am I a genius or what?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He drew a chair next to the screen and started to examine it.
But at that moment Adriana set a tray of coffee down beside the computer,
steaming and fresh, together with dark figs and two bowls of yogurt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Kafe evropaiko</i>,&quot; she commanded, then thrust
a cup into his hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Malista, efcharisto</i>.&quot; He absently nodded
his thanks, took a sip of the steaming brew, then returned his attention to the
screen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At first he thought he was just groggy, his vision playing
tricks, but then the string of letters began to come into focus. Incredible!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, what about this part here,&quot; he asked,
pointing to the fourth line, where the letters turned to nonsensical garbage,
&quot;and then down here again?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's what I was talking about. The interlacing
switches there. It happens every hundred numbers. They started by taking the
second fifty digits and interlacing them back into the first fifty. Then they
switched the algorithm and interlaced the third fifty digits ahead, into the
fourth fifty, but backwards. Then it repeats again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You figured all that out just fooling around with
it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Darling, I do this for a living, for godsake. After a
while you have good instincts.&quot; She tapped her fingers nervously on the
wooden table, then remembered the coffee and reached for a cup. &quot;Nice
little trick. Standard but nice. Every so often you fold the data back into
themselves somehow. That way there are no repetitions of number sequences—for
words that are used a lot—to give you away. But once you've played with this
stuff as much as I have . . . anyway, it's always the first thing I check
for.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Congratulations.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell me the truth.&quot; She looked at him, sipping her
coffee. &quot;Can you really still read this? It's been years.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Memory like an elephant. Though you may have to help me
along now and then.&quot; He pointed. &quot;Look. I think that word's modern
Greek. They've mixed it in where there's not an old word for something.&quot;
He pushed around the computer. &quot;Want to run the whole data file through
your system? Clean it up?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My pleasure.&quot; She was clearing the screen. &quot;I
can't believe it just fell apart like this. The reason our Crays didn't crack
it was it's too simple by half.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He reached for his coffee, feeling a surge of satisfaction.
His hunch had been dead on. Whoever came up with this idea for an encryption
must have been a fan of ancient Greek history, and a knowledgeable one. What
better cipher for Project Daedalus communiques than the language Daedalus
himself used? They'd taken that four-thousand-year-old tongue, an archaic
forerunner of ancient Greek, and then scrambled it using a mathematical
algorithm. Mino Industries was communicating with the Soviets using an encoded
version of Minoan Linear B.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was absolutely poetic. It also appeared, upon first
examination, to be very naive. Yet upon reflection it turned out to be
brilliant. You convert a totally unheard-of language to numbers, throw in a few
encryption tricks, and the result is something that would drive all the hotdog
DES-oriented supercomputers crazy. All those chips would be trying trillions of
keys when there actually was no key. Yes, you had to admit it was inspired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Except the Daedalus crowd was about to experience a problem,
a small headache. Make that a major headache. Because their secret protocol was
about to become headlines. He figured that ought to go a long way toward stopping
any more shooting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay. It's humming.&quot; She reached for her yogurt.
&quot;This time around all the garbage will be gone.&quot; She took a bite,
then burst out laughing. &quot;You know, this is wonderful, working with you.
Darling, I've just decided. Let's do something together, maybe live on the
Ulysses for a while. I might even get to like it. It sounds romantic.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm still looking for the romance in life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, love, you've found it. It's me.&quot; She leaned
over and kissed him on the lips. &quot;End of quest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thought I'd never hear you say that. But first you have
to help me translate this. I'm over a decade out of date. My modern Greek's a
little rusty too, and a lot of the technical terms in this look to be
transliterated—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, sweetie, that's not the first thing we have to do.
The first thing is to make sure you've got a separate copy of anything you're
working with. Not in the computer. I'll spare you my horror stories about
erased files, hard disks going down, all the rest.&quot; She was rising,
energized. &quot;Cardinal computer rule number one. Always dupe anything you're
working on, no matter how sure you are nothing can go wrong. Believe me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sounds good.&quot; He looked up. &quot;What are you doing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I need that disk I showed you tonight. We can use it
for the backup. It's in my purse, which I now realize I left in the car when I
came in. I was slightly crazy at the time.&quot; She was turning. &quot;God, it
seems like ages.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, why don't you let me—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You don't know where I parked it. My secret hiding
place.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe we ought to send Zeno, or Adriana—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just sit tight. Only be a minute.&quot; She wrapped her

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you still awake?&quot; Zeno was trudging into the
room, still wearing his frayed nightshirt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We just solved the riddle of the sphinx, old friend. Except
now we have to translate it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You should be sleeping, Michael. Go now, catch an hour
or so. I will start making arrangements. Get tickets for you both on the car
ferry to Athens, a pistol, maybe new passports if you want. We have work to
do.&quot; He reached and took the cup of coffee Adriana was urging on him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right. As soon as she gets back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?&quot; He froze, then looked toward the back.
&quot;What do you mean? I thought she was still asleep.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She went out to the car, wherever it is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I wish she had asked me. I would have been happy—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know how she is. There's no stopping her when she
gets rolling.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is not good.&quot; He turned and called to Adriana
to bring his trousers and shoes. &quot;We must find her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're right. It was stupid. Damned stupid.&quot; He
was getting up. &quot;Let's do it together.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The morning air was sharp and she wished she'd grabbed one of
Adriana's black knit shawls before going out. Could she pass for one of those
stooped Greek peasant women? she wondered. Not likely. She shivered and pulled
her thin coat around her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The rain was over now, leaving the air moist and fragrant,
but the early morning gloom had an ominous undertone. They'd found the key to
open the first box, but the message inside still had to be translated. What was
it? What could possibly be in the protocol that would make somebody want to
kill her?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stared down the vacant street leading away from the
square, a mosaic of predawn shadows, and tried to think.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Alex Novosty was the classic middleman, that much
was a given. But then she'd known that for years. Yes, she'd known about Alex
Novosty all her life—his work for the KGB, his laundering of Techmashimport
funds. She knew about it because they were second cousins. Fortunately their
family tie was distant enough not to have made its way into NSA's security
file, but around the Russian expatriate dinner tables of Brighton Beach and
Oyster Bay, Alex was very well known indeed. He was the Romanov descendant
who'd sold out to the Soviets, an unforgivable lapse of breeding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But for all that, he wasn't an assassin. For him to do what
he'd done tonight could only mean one thing: he was terrified. Very out of
character. But why?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The answer to that wasn't hard: He must be mixed up in
Project Daedalus, whatever it was, right up to his shifty eyeballs. But what
about Michael? What did Alex want from him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The answer to that could go a lot of ways. When she first met
Michael Vance, Jr., she'd been smitten by the fact he was so different. Always
kidding around, yet tough as steel when anybody crossed him. A WASP street
fighter. She liked that a lot. He was somebody she felt she could depend on, no
matter what.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She still remembered her first sight of Mike as though it
were yesterday. She was taking notes on Etruscan pottery in a black notebook,
standing in a corner of the Yale art gallery on Chapel Street, when she looked
up and—no, it couldn't be. She felt herself just gawking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd caught her look and strolled over with a puzzled smile.
&quot;Is my tie crooked, or—&quot; Then he laughed. &quot;Name's Mike Vance. I
used to be part of this place. How about you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Vance?&quot; She'd just kept on staring, still not
quite believing her eyes. &quot;My thesis adviser at Penn was . . . you look
just like him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And he did. The same sharp chin, the same twinkle in the blue
eyes. Even when he was angry, as Mike certainly had been that day, he seemed to
be having fun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thus it began.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At first they were so right for each other it seemed as
though she'd known Michael Vance for approximately a hundred years, give or
take. She'd been one of his father's many ardent disciples, and after finishing
her master's at Penn, she'd gone on to become a doctoral candidate at Yale,
where she'd specialized in the linguistics of the ancient Aegean languages.
She'd known but forgotten that Michael Vance, Sr., had a son who was finishing
his own doctorate at Yale, writing a dissertation about Minoan Crete.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That day in the museum he was steaming, declaring he'd
dropped by one last time as part of a ritualistic, formal farewell to
archaeology. The decision was connected with the hostile reception being given
a book he'd just published, a commercial version of his dissertation. As of
that day he'd decided to tell academia to stuff it. He'd be doing something
else for a living. There'd been feelers from some agency in D.C. about helping
trace hot money.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the brief weeks that followed they grew inseparable, the
perfect couple. One weekend they'd scout the New England countryside for
old-fashioned inns, the next they'd drive up to Boston to spend a day in the
Museum of Fine Arts, then come back and argue and make love till dawn in her
New Haven apartment. During all those days and nights, she came very close to
talking him out of quitting university life. Close, but she didn't.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had put off everything for a couple of months, and they
had traveled the world—London, Greece, Morocco, Moscow. Once their parents even
met, at Count Sergei Borodin's sprawling Oyster Bay home. It was a convocation
of the Russian Nobility Association, with three hundred guests in attendance,
and the air rang with Russian songs and balalaikas. Michael Vance, Sr., who
arrived in his natty bowler, scarcely knew what to make of all the Slavic
exuberance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shortly after that, the intensity of Michael became too much
for her. She felt herself being drawn into his orbit, and she wanted an orbit
of her own. The next thing she knew, he'd departed for the Caribbean; her
father had died; and she'd gone back to work on her own doctorate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Michael. He was driven, obsessive, always determined to do
what he wanted, just as she was. But the tension that likeness brought to their
relationship those many years ago now made everything seem to click. Why? she
wondered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe it was merely as simple as life cycles. Maybe back then
they were just out of synch. He'd already survived his first midlife crisis,
even though he was hardly thirty. When they split up, she'd been twenty-five
and at the beginning of a campaign to test herself, find out what she could do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, she thought, she'd found out. She was good, very good.
So now what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was relieved to see the car was still parked on the side
street, actually a little alley, where she'd left it. Thinking more clearly
now, she realized she'd been a trifle careless, stashing the car in the first
location she could find and then running for Zeno's.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she headed down the alley in between the white plaster
houses, she suddenly felt her heart stop. Someone was standing next to the
Saab, a dark figure waiting. She watched as it suddenly moved briskly toward
her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alex Novosty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?&quot; She couldn't believe her eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Budetya ostorozhyi</i>!&quot; He whispered the
warning as he raised his hand and furtively tried to urge her back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Kak! Shto—?</i>&quot; She froze. &quot;How did you
find the car?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;The hotel. They directed us to a <i>kafeneion </i>near
here, but then I noticed your car. I thought . . .&quot; He moved out of the
shadows, quickly, still speaking in Russian. &quot;Just tell me where you have
the copies of the protocol, quickly. Maybe I can still handle it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Handle what?&quot; That's when she saw the two other
men, in dark overcoats, against the shadow of the building.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The . . . situation.&quot; His eyes were intense.
&quot;They want it back, all copies. I've tried to tell them that killing you
won't solve anything, but—&quot; He glanced back with a small shiver. &quot;You
must tell them Michael has a copy, stall them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's true. He does.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No! Then say there's a copy back in your office. Just
let me try and—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alex, I'm not going to play any more of your
games.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Please,&quot; he continued in a whisper, &quot;don't
contradict anything I say. Let me do the talking. I'll—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're in it with them, aren't you?&quot; She tried to
push past. &quot;Well, you can tell your friends we're onto their 'project.' If
anything happens to me, Michael will track them down and personally take them
apart. Tell them that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You don't understand.&quot; He caught her arm.
&quot;One of their people was killed tonight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The one trying to shoot Michael and me, you mean?&quot;
She was trying to calm the quaver in her voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He was killed by the KGB. I had nothing to do
with—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is that what you told them?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the way it happened. There was an
argument.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Over  what?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Everybody wants you. It's the protocol.&quot; His look
darkened. &quot;Eva, they are in no mood for niceties.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Neither am I.&quot; She noticed the two men were now
moving toward them. One was taller and seemed to be in charge, but they both
were carrying what looked like small-caliber automatic weapons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The protocol, whatever it was, was still in code. She didn't
know what she didn't know. How could she bargain?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was too late to think about it now. Their faces were hard
and smooth, with the cold eyes of men who killed on command. My God, she
thought, what had Michael said about the <i>Mino-gumi</i>?</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>The Japanese mob.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The taller man, she was soon to learn, was Kazuo Ina- gawa,
who had been a London-based <i>kobun </i>for the <i>Mino-gumi </i>for the past
decade. He had a thin, pasty face and had once been first <i>kobun</i> for
their entire Osaka organization, in charge of gambling and nightclub
shakedowns. Even in the early dawn light, he wore sunglasses, masking his eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The shorter one was Takahashi Takenaka, whose pockmarked face
was distinguished by a thin moustache, an aquiline nose, and the same
sunglasses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alex, she realized, must have lied to them, covering up what
really happened out at the palace. Now he was bluffing for his life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You can just tell them I don't know anything about
it.&quot; She felt the cold air closing in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Eva, that's impossible. They know you were given the
protocol. Now where is it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He clearly wanted her to say it was somewhere else. But why
bother?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's in the car. In my purse.&quot; She pointed.
&quot;Why don't they just go ahead and take it? By the way, it's still encrypted.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She fumbled in her pockets. &quot;Here's . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she realized she'd left the key in the car. There it
dangled, inside the locked door. Her purse rested on the seat across from the
driver's side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Get it,&quot; Inagawa commanded his lieutenant.
Takenaka bowed obediently, then turned and tried the door handle, without
success.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>So</i>.&quot; He frowned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Inagawa muttered a curse and brutally slammed the butt of his
automatic against the curved window. The sound of splintering glass rent the
morning air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Quickly Novosty stepped forward and reached through to unlock
the door. Then he pulled it open and leaned in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why is he doing it? she wondered. Easy answer: He's trying to
keep control of the situation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whose side is he really on?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he backed out and handed her the brown leather purse
while he tried to catch her eye.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She took it, snapped it open, and lifted out the gray
computer disk. &quot;There,&quot; she said as she handed it to Inagawa,
&quot;whatever's on it, you'll have to figure it out for yourself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That can't be the only one,&quot; Novosty sputtered.
&quot;Surely there are other copies.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's it, sweetheart.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Inagawa turned it in his hand, then passed it to Takenaka and
said something in Japanese. The other man took it, then barked <i>“Hai” </i>and
bowed lightly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>&quot;Are you sure this is the only copy?&quot;
Inagawa asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The only one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He nodded to his lieutenant, who began screwing a dark
silencer onto the barrel of his automatic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Oh my God, she thought. They're going to finish the job.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Wait.&quot; Novosty reached for his arm. &quot;She's
lying. This is a disk from a computer. There must be other copies.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes.&quot; She was finally coming to her senses.
&quot;There are plenty of other copies. In my computer. In—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where is it?&quot; Inagawa looked at her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's—it's at the hotel. The Galaxy.&quot; She was
trying desperately to think. &quot;And then I left another—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're lying. We have been there. They said a tavern
keeper came and took all your luggage.&quot; He was staring down the street,
toward Zeno's place. &quot;They also told us where he could be found. We will
go there now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My friends,&quot; Novosty interrupted again, &quot;it
would be most unwise to attempt any violence on a Greek national here. The
consequences could be extremely awkward, for all of us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We must retrieve it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why not do it the easy way?&quot; He tried to
smile. &quot;There's another man here, traveling with her. We should work
through him. I know he will deal. He's a professional.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who is he?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;An American. If we hold her, keep her alive, we can use
her to make him bring it to us. We can offer a trade.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No. We will just find him and take it.&quot; Inagawa
started to move. &quot;Now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's armed, my friends,&quot; Novosty continued evenly.
&quot;He's also experienced. There would be gunfire, I promise you. If that
happened, you could have the entire street here filled with rifles in a minute.
You do not know these people as I do. They still remember World War Two and the
Resistance. Killing unfriendly foreigners became a way of life some of them
have yet to forget.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Alex is bluffing, she thought. Again. Michael
doesn't have a gun. Does Zeno? Who knows?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me try and talk to him,&quot; Novosty continued.
&quot;Surely something can be worked out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You will stay here, with us.&quot; Inagawa seized his
arm, then turned and began a heated exchange with his partner. Again Takenaka
bowed repeatedly, sucking in his breath and muttering hai. At last they seemed
to arrive at a consensus, though it was the taller man who'd actually made the
decision, whatever it was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She comes with us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, no I don't.&quot; She looked at Novosty, who seemed
defeated, then back at the Japanese. She suddenly realized she was on her own.
Novosty had played all his cards. &quot;If I don't reappear in Washington day
after tomorrow, you'll have the entire U.S. National Security Agency looking
for me. People know I'm here. So think about that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is not our concern.&quot; Inagawa reached for her.
&quot;We do not work for the American government.&quot; Then he turned to Novosty.
&quot;Tell your friend that this woman will be released when we have all copies
of the protocol. All. Do you understand?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But how can I tell him if you won't let me—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is your problem.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps . . . perhaps we should just leave a message
here,&quot; Novosty sputtered. &quot;I'm sure he'll find the car.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alex, I'm not going anywhere with these animals.&quot;
She drew back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't worry. I'll take care of everything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, I'm not—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was all she could say before a hand was roughly clapped
against her mouth, her body shoved against the broken window.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mike Vance and Zeno Stantopoulos searched for over half an
hour before they found the Saab. When they did, the left-hand window was
broken, and Eva's purse was missing. She was missing too. The only thing
remaining was a hastily scrawled note from Alex Novosty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Vance?&quot; The portly, balding desk clerk studied his
computer screen at the Athenaeum Inter-Continental. Here in this teeming marble
lobby the new world met the old. &quot;Dr. M. Vance. Yes, we have your
reservation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good. Novosty had done exactly what he said. The play was
going down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Welcome back.&quot; The man looked up and smiled, his
eyes mirroring the green numbers on the screen as he looked over Vance's
shoulder. &quot;Our records show you were just with us, four days ago. We still
have your old room, if you like.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That would be fine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was back in a city renowned as much for its hospitality as
for its mind-numbing brown haze of smog. It was also said to be the safest city
in Europe, with a miniscule crime rate. However, Michael Vance did not feel
safe as he stood in the lobby of Athens's most luxurious hotel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Were you on a bus tour of the Peloponnisos,
perhaps?&quot; the clerk continued with a pale smile, his voice trying for
perfunctory brightness. &quot;The Mycenean ruins in the south are always—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Business.&quot; Vance tossed his passport onto the
counter. They both knew he didn't look anything like a candidate for a four-day
CHAT package tour on a bus. But the man seemed nervous, anxious to make
conversation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll be needing a car in the morning. Early. Is that in
your reservation file too?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No problem.&quot; The clerk ignored, or missed, his
impatient tone. &quot;We have a Hertz outlet now, just over there,&quot; he
pointed, &quot;next to the travel desk. I'm sure they will be happy to arrange
for it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance tossed his Amex card onto the counter, then reached for
the slate clipboard holding the registration slip. Dusk was falling outside,
but here in the warm glow of chandeliers the moment felt like sleepwalking. His
mental bearings kept shifting. Nothing was real. He wanted to think it was
merely routine, like checking into a thousand other streamlined international
hotels, something he'd done more times than he cared to count. But that was
wrong; danger lurked somewhere nearby. His senses were warning him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He kept thinking about Eva. Was she serious about getting
back together, sailing on the Ulysses? Maybe he didn't know her as well as he
thought, which was troubling for a lot of reasons, not the least being that
right now he needed to be able to think exactly the way she did. They'd have to
work as a perfectly coordinated team tomorrow, with no rehearsals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May I have someone take your bag?&quot; The clerk
glanced down at the new leather suitcase sitting on the floor, then reached to
ring for a bellhop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No.&quot; Vance lunged to stop his hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whoa, he lectured himself, chill out. Keep the lid on. Why
not just let it happen? Here. Maybe you want them to do it here. Why wait?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The clerk tried to hold his composure. &quot;As you wish. Of
course you know your room.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can find it.&quot; He tried to smile, then thumbed
over his shoulder. &quot;You're busy anyway. The tour coming in . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes.&quot; The clerk was shoving across the heavy brass
key. &quot;You remember our schedule. Breakfast is served until ten over there
in the dining room, eleven in your room.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thanks.&quot; He picked up the bag, heavy, and turned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The rental car desk was across the lobby, past the tour group
now pouring through the revolving doors. They clearly were just off a Paris
flight, chattering in French, brandishing tour badges, and quarreling about
luggage with Gallic impatience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I need a car for tomorrow. Early.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The dark-haired woman at the desk looked up as he began
fishing for his credit card and driver's license. Her Hertz uniform was
unbuttoned down the front to display as much of her bosom as Greek propriety,
perhaps even the law, would permit. A heavy silver chain nestled between her
ample breasts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Our pleasure.&quot; She swept back her hair as she
mechanically shoved forward a typed sheet encased in smudged cellophane.
&quot;We have some new Austin subcompacts, or if you want a full-size—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's the best car you've got?&quot; It would be a
long drive, over uncertain Greek roads. He wanted to take no chances.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We do have an Alfa, sir. Only one. A Milano.&quot; She
absently adjusted the V-neck of her uniform. &quot;For VIPs. I should warn you
it's expensive.&quot; She bent forward to whisper. &quot;To tell you the truth,
<i>ine poli akrivo</i>. It's a rip- off.&quot; She leaned back, proud of her
new American slang. &quot;Take my advice and—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Can you have it here, out front, at six in the
morning?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can check.&quot; She sniffed, then reached for the
battered phone. A quick exchange in Greek followed, then she hung up.
&quot;They say it just came in. There should be no problem.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He glanced around the lobby once more as she picked up the
charge card and license to begin filling out the form. There was still no sign,
no indication. And yet the whole scene felt wrong. Something, something was
warning him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's what it was. The man standing across the lobby, at the
far side next to the elevators. He had a newspaper folded in his hand, but he
wasn't reading. He was speaking into it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hotel security? Not a chance. For one thing, he wasn't Greek.
Although he was too far away to see his face, something about the way he stood
gave him away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Where the hell was Novosty? This wasn't supposed to be the
drill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He suddenly found himself wondering how much clout Alex had
left. Maybe Novosty was out of the play. Maybe the rules had changed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Could you please hurry that along.&quot; He turned back
to the dark-haired girl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You said you wouldn't be needing the car until tomorrow,
sir.&quot; Formal now, abrupt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I just changed my mind. I'd like it tonight. Right now,
as a matter of fact.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you want the insurance? It will be an extra—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No. Yes. Look, I don't care. Just let me sign that
damned thing and give me the keys.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, give me a chance.&quot; She petulantly turned the
form toward him and shoved it across the desk. &quot;If you'll just initial
here and here,&quot; she was pointing with her pen, &quot;and sign there. And
did you say you wanted the car now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Immediately.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm afraid that's not possible.&quot; She retrieved the
form.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's just—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then give me something else.&quot; He glanced toward
the man, still speaking into his newspaper, then back. They would make their
move any second now. &quot;What's the problem with the car?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm trying to tell you it just came in. Our people will
need at least half an hour to clean it, go over the checklist. So if you'd like
to have a cup of coffee in the dining room, I'll call you when—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where is it now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They said it's just been returned. It's probably parked
somewhere outside.&quot; She gestured toward the glass revolving door.
&quot;Across the street. That's where they usually—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;An Alfa?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's right. Dark blue. But like I said, it's
not—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Give me the keys.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They're probably still in it. Our people—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thanks.&quot; He reached down for the suitcase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your card, sir, and your license.&quot; She pushed the
items across with a tight smile, clearly happy to be rid of him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he reached for them, out of the corner of his eye he saw
the first movement. The man had stuffed the newspaper, and walkie-talkie, into
his trench coat and was approaching across the marble lobby. Just as Vance
expected, the garb was polyester, the hair a slicked-up punch-perm, but he
still couldn't make out the face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He didn't need to. He knew who they were. The encounter at
Knossos flashed through his mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>They know I've got a copy of their protocol. And
until that gets iced, there's always a chance their secret is no longer a
secret. But they can't know we've cracked the encryption. Unless she told them.
Which she never would.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No, they couldn't know that yet, which meant he still had the
bargaining chip he'd need.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Except for one problem. They were about to try and break the
rules. Just like the old days. Maybe they'd forgot he knew how to break rules
too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he pushed through the milling crowd of French tourists,
suitcases and knapsacks piling up near the entrance, he sensed the man was
gaining. But only a few feet more and he'd be at the revolving door. Halfway
home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This wasn't going to be easy. There'd be a backup. Probably
just outside, at the entrance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he reached for the rubber flange of the revolving door, he
knew the man was just behind him, maybe two steps. Just right. He turned to see
a hand emerge from the polyester suit jacket, grasping a Heckler &amp; Koch KA1
machine pistol, a cut-down version of the MP5.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The barrel was rising, the hard face closing in. But it was
the suitcase he wanted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So why not give it to him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Here.&quot; He jammed his foot into the revolving door,
leaving a small opening, then wheeled around, hoisting the case. The quick turn
brought just enough surprise to break his attacker's momentum. As the man
involuntarily raised his left hand, Vance caught his right wrist, just back of
the pistol's grip, and shoved it forward, into the door. Then he brought up his
elbow and smashed it into the attacker's jaw. As the man groaned, he caught his
other wrist and shoved him around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He rammed his shoulder against the revolving door, closing it
and wedging the gun inside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let's keep this simple, okay? No muss, no fuss.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He threw his full weight against the man's body, bending him
back around the curved metal and glass of the door. There was a snap and a
muted groan as the wrist bones shattered. The machine pistol clattered to the
marble floor inside the circular enclosure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sorry about that.&quot; Before the attacker could
regain his balance, he kneed him into the next revolving partition and rammed
it closed. Only one foot remained outside, kicking at an awkward angle across
the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now where's the other one? He glanced around as he drew away.
There's sure to be two. Somebody was on the other end of that radio. Novosty?
Did he set this up?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He swept up the suitcase and shouldered his way through the
auxiliary door on the side. Odd, but the scuffle had gone unnoticed amid the
din of the arriving tour. Or maybe Parisians weren't ruffled by anything so
everyday as an attempted murder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he emerged onto the street, he saw what he was looking
for. The other assailant was waiting just across the wide entryway, past the
jumble of bellboys, taxi drivers, and the last straggle of tourists coming off
the bus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Their eyes met, and the man's right hand darted inside his
dark suit jacket.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Use the crowd, Vance thought. Enough hand-to-hand heroics.
These guys mean business.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since the pile of luggage coming off the bus separated them,
he had an advantage now, if only for a second or so. Without thinking he seized
the straps of a canvas knapsack sitting on the sidewalk with his free hand and
flung it with all his strength.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It caught his attacker squarely in the chest, breaking his
rhythm and knocking him back half a step. It was only a moment's reprieve, but
it was all Vance needed to disappear around the rear of the bus, which was
pouring black exhaust into the evening air, blocking all view of the avenue.
Maybe he could move fast enough to just disappear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he dashed into the honking traffic, headlights half
blinding him, he surveyed the street opposite looking for the Alfa.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There? No. There?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A pair of headlights swerved by, inches away, accompanied by
honking and a cursing Greek driver. Only a few feet more now and he'd be
across.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There. A blue Alfa. It had to be the one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But it was already moving, its front wheels turning inward as
the Hertz attendant backed it around to begin pulling out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He wrenched open the door and seized a brown sleeve. The arm
inside belonged to a young Greek, barely twenty, his uniform grease-covered and
wrinkled. He looked up, surprise in his eyes, and grabbed for the door handle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Change of plans.&quot; Vance heard the Alfa's bumper
slam against the car parked behind as the startled attendant's foot brushed
against the accelerator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Den katalaveno!</i>&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Out.&quot; Vance yanked him around and shoved
him toward the asphalt pavement. &quot;And stay down.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now the bus had begun pulling out from the entryway across
the street. Although traffic still clogged the avenue, he was a clear target.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He threw the suitcase onto the seat, then slid in and reached
to secure the door. As he pulled it shut, he heard the ping of a bullet
ricochetting off metal somewhere. Next came a burst of automatic fire that
seemed to splatter all around him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The young Greek pulled himself up off the pavement and
reached . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Down.&quot; Vance waved him away as he shifted the
transmission into drive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment a slug caught the young attendant in the
shoulder, spinning him around. He gave a yelp of surprise, then stumbled
backward. But now he was out of the way, clear, with what was probably only a
flesh wound.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance shoved his foot against the accelerator, ramming the
rear fender of the car in front, then again, knocking it clear. Another spray
of bullets spattered through the back window as he pulled into the flow of
traffic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Your time will come, friend, he told himself. Tomorrow, by
God, we finish this little dance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He finally became aware of the pumping of his own heart as he
made his way north up Syngrou Avenue, trying to urge the traffic forward by
sheer will.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The thing now was to get out of Athens, take Leoforos Athinon
west, then head up the new Highway 1 toward the mountains, lose them in the
country, find some place to spend the night. His final destination was only
about two hundred kilometers away. He just had to be fresh and ready tomorrow,
with everything in place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But at least he now knew the game had no rules. Maybe knowing
that gave him an edge. And so far his timing was still intact. He'd handled it.
Maybe not too well, maybe with too much risk, but he'd handled it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Novosty's note had said there would be a straight swap. But
the other team clearly had no intention of bothering with niceties. Fine. That
cut both ways.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=bookmark28><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sunday 11:45<span style='text-transform:uppercase'> a.m.</span></span></b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The place was Delphi, the location Novosty had specified.
Heading warily up the Sacred Way, Vance paused for a moment to take in the
view. From where he stood, the vista was majestic, overwhelming humanity's puny
scale. He'd always loved it. Toward the north the sheer granite cliffs of the
Phaedriades Mountains towered almost two thousand feet skyward to form a
semicircular barrier, while down below the river Pleistos meandered through
mile after mile of dark olive groves. It was an eyeful of rugged grandeur,
craggy peaks encircling a harsh plain that stretched as far as the eye could
see. Greece in the midday sun: austere, timeless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His destination, the ancient temple of the Delphic oracle
farther up the hill, overlooked this panorama, row center in a magnificient
natural amphitheater. The Greek legends told that the great god Zeus had once
dispatched two eagles, one flying east and one flying west, to find out where
they would meet. They came together at the center</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>of the
earth, Delphi, whose main temple, the Sanctuary of Apollo, contained the
domelike boulder Omphalos, thereafter named the &quot;navel of the world.&quot;
Here east and west met.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd parked the Alfa on the roadway down below, and now as he
stared up the mountainside, past the conical cypress trees, he could just make
out the remains of the stone temple where almost three thousand years ago the
priestess, the Delphic oracle, screamed her prophesies. She was a Pythia, an
ancient woman innocent of mind who lived in the depths of the temple next to a
fiery altar whose flame was attended night and day. There, perched on a high
tripod poised over a vaporous fissure in the earth, she inhaled intoxicating
gases, chewed laurel leaves, and issued wild, frenzied utterances. Those
incoherent sounds were translated by priests into answers appropriate to the
queries set before her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Delphi. He loved its remote setting, its sacred legends.
Those stories, in fact, told that the god Apollo had once summoned priests from
Crete, the ancient font of culture, to come here to create this Holy of Holies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was he about to become a priest too? After sending off a
telegram to the Stuttgart team, notifying them of a delay in his schedule, he'd
journeyed from that island back to Athens via the ANEK Lines overnight car
ferry from Iraklion. Not at all godlike. But it had a well-worn forward section
it called first class, and it was a low-profile mode of travel, requiring no
identity questions. He'd ended up in the bar of the tourist section for much of
the trip, stretched out on a stained couch and napping intermittently during
the twelve-hour voyage. It had cleared his mind. Then from Piraeus, the port of
Athens, he'd taken a cab into the city. After that the hotel and the car.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he stared up the hill, he had in his possession a wallet
with nine hundred American dollars and eighty thousand Greek drachmas, the
suitcase, and a Spanish 9mm automatic from Zeno. He also had a translated
version of the opening section of the protocol.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His anger still simmering, he continued up the cobbled path
of the Sacred Way, toward the exposed remains of the oracle's temple situated
halfway up the hill. Nothing was left of the structure now except its stone
floor and a few columns that had been re-erected, standing bare and wistful in
the sunshine. In fact, the only building at Delphi that had been rebuilt to
anything resembling its original glory was the small marble &quot;treasure
house&quot; of the Athenians, a showplace of that city's wealth dating from 480
B.C. Today its simple white blocks glistened in the harsh midday glare, while
tourists milled around speaking German, French, English, or Dutch. Even in the
simmering heat of noon, Delphi still attracted visitors who revered the ancient
Greeks as devoutly as those Greeks had once worshipped their own adulterous
gods and goddesses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So where the hell was Novosty? Noon at the Temple of Apollo,
his note had said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He searched the hillside looking for telltale signs of another
ambush—movement, color, anything. But there was nothing. Although tourists
wandered about, the temple ruins seemed abandoned for thousands of years, their
silence almost palpable. Even the sky was empty save for a few swooping hawks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If Alex is here waiting, he asked himself, where would he be?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he looked again at the treasure house. Of course.
Probably in there, taking a little respite from the blistering sun. It figured.
The front, its columns, and porch were open, and the interior would be
protected. Conveniently, the wide steps of the stone pathway led directly past.
A natural rendezvous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In his belt, under his suede jacket, was Zeno's 9mm Llama. It
was fully loaded, with fifteen rounds in the magazine plus one up the tube. He
reached into his belt and eased off the safety.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Holding it beneath his coat, he continued on up the cobbled
pathway toward the front of the treasure house. As he moved into the shade of
the portico, he thought for a moment he heard sounds from inside. He stopped,
gripping the Llama, and listened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No, nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Slowly, carefully, he walked up the steps. When he reached
the top, he paused, then gingerly stepped in through the open doorway. It was
cool and dank inside. And empty. His footsteps rang hollow on the stone floor.
Maybe Novosty's dead by now, he thought fleetingly. Maybe his luck finally ran
out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned and walked back out to the porch, then settled
himself on the steps. In the valley below, beyond the milling tourists, the
dark green olive groves spread out toward the horizon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The protocol. The mind-boggling protocol. Something was afoot
that would change the balance of world power. He'd translated the first page of
Article I, but it had raised more questions than it answered. All the same,
he'd taken action. Today he was ready.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Novosty had to know the score. Had to. But now Vance knew at
least part of the story too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He glanced down at the suitcase. It contained Eva's Zenith
Turbo 486, of course, which undoubtedly was why it was such a popular item. But
it also had a hard copy of the scrambled text of the protocol, courtesy of a
printer Zeno had borrowed from a newspaper office in Iraklion, as well as a
photocopy of Vance's partial translation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They didn't know it yet, but there was another full copy,
which he'd transmitted by DataNet to his &quot;office&quot; computer in Nassau.
It was waiting there in the silicon memory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Quite a document. Twenty-eight pages in length, it was the
final version of a legally binding agreement that had been hammered out over a
long period of time. From the page he'd translated, he could recognize the
style. The text referred to the rights and obligations of two distinct
entities—the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Mino Industries Group.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he seated himself beneath a lone almond tree and took a
last look at the olive groves down below, he was tempted to pull out the
translation and reread it one more time. But that was unnecessary; he'd
memorized it, right down to the last comma.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Among the clusters of tourists on the road below, a white
limousine was pulling to a stop, followed by a gray Saab.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>He watched
as Novosty emerged from the Saab and glanced up the hill, then started the
climb. Nobody got out of the limo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance watched as he slowly made his way along the cobbled
path leading up the hill, puffing. He was almost out of breath by the time he
reached the top.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, I'm so glad you could manage to make it.&quot;
He heaved a sigh as he trudged up the last remaining steps.</span></p>

color:windowtext'>&quot;It was the lure of your scintillating company.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is Eva down there? She'd damned well better be.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She is safe.&quot; Novosty sighed again. &quot;It was
most unwise for her to have gotten involved in all this, Michael. She is making
matters difficult for us all.&quot;</span></p>

client's gorillas are trying to kill Eva and me. Me, your new partner. Things
like that tend to inspire mistrust, and just when we were starting to hit it
off so well.&quot; He finally stood up, holding the Llama. Novosty was lounging
nervously in the sunshine, fishing for a cigarette. &quot;Where's your Uzi? You
just may need it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, all this has nothing to do with me.&quot; His
eyes were weary. &quot;I'm operating independently this time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Cash and carry. Maybe you should just post your prices,
like a cheap cathouse.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I prefer to think of myself as an expediter. But this
time I encountered more difficulties than reasonably could be anticipated.
Which is why I need your help now to straighten it out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What? The whole shoddy scene? Looks like the KGB's hot
on the trail, say maybe about two feet in back of your ass. Or is it your
client, who you're about to try and screw out of a hundred million dollars?
Incidentally, that's probably a serious miscalculation, health-wise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The situation <i>has</i> grown awkward.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Of course that touching fable about returning
the hundred million to Moscow was just the usual 'disinformation.' &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You are perfectly correct. It will not be returned. But
any thought I might have had of keeping it now also seems out of the
question.&quot; He sighed. &quot;Instead I'm afraid we must—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>We</i>? Now that's what I call balls of brass.&quot;
He laughed. &quot;Surely even a fevered imagination like yours can't suppose—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, I told you I would split the commission I took
for cleaning it. That offer still holds. Fifty-fifty. I might even go
sixty-forty. What more can you want? But those funds must be delivered. Given
the new situation—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not by me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Be a realist, my friend. I no longer have freedom of
movement, so now you are my only hope. If those funds aren't transferred within
the week, I'd prefer not to reflect on the consequences.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The consequences to your own neck, you mean.&quot;
Vance stared at him. &quot;By the way, just out of curiosity, what's the
'prototype'?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the one thing I cannot possibly discuss,
Michael.&quot; Novosty caught his breath. &quot;But what if the contract for it
is abrogated because of those funds not being delivered, what then? What if the
USSR just makes a move to seize it? I fear there could be war, my friend. Bang,
the apocalypse.&quot; He flicked his lighter. &quot;Even worse though, as you
say, both parties to the agreement would probably spend a week devising the
most interesting way possible for me to depart this earth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If the KGB somehow locates and freezes the embezzled
funds before you can finish transferring them, it could scuttle the whole deal.
Mino Industries would probably be very annoyed. Not to mention certain parties
back home.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Precisely. You can see we are on a knife edge here. But
first things first. You must return Eva's pirate copy of the protocol, please.
I beg you. It must disappear. I have promised them that, as an act of good
faith. I'm afraid the participants in Tokyo are near to losing patience with
me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what about her?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She's with them now.&quot; He pointed down the hill, to
the long white limousine. &quot;Unfortunately, they have taken over the
situation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Better buckle your seat belt, pal. It's about to be a
bumpy afternoon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She is safe, don't worry. They have assured me. It is
only the protocol they care about. The matter of security. They know you have
her only other copy, in the computer. Now please let me just give whatever you
have to them. Then let's all try and forget she ever had it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, those hoods down there tried a little number
on me last night in Athens.&quot; He hadn't moved. &quot;It took the edge off
my evening.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, I tried to tell them that was imprudent. But
they are very concerned about time. Just be reasonable, my friend, and I'm sure
everything can be straightened out.&quot; He sighed again. &quot;You know,
these tactics of kidnapping and such are very distasteful to me as well. But
when she told them she didn't have all the material, that you still had a copy,
they decided that taking her into their custody was the best way to ensure your
cooperation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They don't know me very well.&quot; He looked down the
hill. &quot;Tell your buddies they can go take a jump. Nobody blackmails me.
Nobody. I plan to hang on to this little suitcase till she's out of danger.
That's how we're going to work things. Tell them it's her insurance. They
release her right now, or I'll personally blow their whole deal sky high.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell them yourself, Michael. I'm just here as an observer.&quot;
He gestured toward the white limo parked below, nestled in among the line of
tourist automobiles and busses. &quot;And while you're doing that, perhaps you
should ask her if that's her wish as well. They refuse to release her until
they recover the materials she had. They are calling it 'protection.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stared down. &quot;You've got a hell of a nerve. All of
you. Alex, when this is over—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Please. Let's just get this ghastly protocol affair
sorted out.&quot; He rubbed at his beard. &quot;Then we can all concern
ourselves with what's really important. The money.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right. I almost forgot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He scanned the hillside. Was everything set? He'd seen no
sign. But then that's how it was supposed to be. The other problem was the
tourists, everywhere, complicating the play.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But maybe the tourists would be a help, would make it start
out slow. Think. How can you use them? Clearly the other side had hoped for an
abandoned place in the middle of nowhere. They had to be off balance now too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He hesitated a moment, then decided. Go for it. He had the
Llama. Just settle it here and now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He took one last look at the temple as he rose. The Delphic
oracle. That's what Eva had been all along. She'd somehow divined the outlines
of the story, but after the disappearance of her old lover at the NSA she
didn't dare speak it directly. Everything was coded language. So what bette</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r place</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> than here on this mountain to
finally have a little plain talk?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they passed down the last stone steps leading to the
roadway, he found himself thinking about Mino Industries. Did they really have
half a trillion dollars lying around? Not likely. To come up with that kind of
money, even in Japan, you'd have to be deeply plugged into legitimate financial
circles—pension funds, insurance companies, brokerage houses, banks, all the
rest. But still, the <i>Mino-gumi</i> had connections that went wide and deep,
everywhere. Their <i>oyabun</i>, Tanzan Mino, had been in the game for a long,
long time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now, as he approached the limousine, one of its white doors
slowly began to open. Then a Japanese emerged, dressed in a black polyester
suit. He wore dark sunglasses, and his right wrist was in a cast. The eyes were
very familiar. Also, one of his little fingers was missing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But Vance's gaze didn't linger long on the hands. His
attention was riveted on what was in them. Yep, he'd seen it right last night.
It was a Heckler &amp; Koch machine pistol. One of those could lay down all
thirty rounds in an eight- inch group at thirty yards. World-class hardware.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It figured. The <i>Mino-gumi</i> was known everywhere as the
best-run Yakuza syndicate of them all. Hardened criminals, they considered
themselves modern-day samurai, upholding some centuries-old code of honor. It
was a contradiction only the Japanese mind could fully accommodate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Heavy-duty connections, Vance told himself, the very best.
Which meant Novosty was in even bigger trouble than he probably imagined. The
latest rumor in the world of hot money was that Tanzan Mino and his Yakuza had,
through dummy fronts, just bought up half of Hawaii. If that were true, it
meant he laundered real money these days. Who the hell needed a small-time
operator like Alex?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the man reached in and caught Eva's arm, pulling her
into the midday glare.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thank God, he thought, she still looks vaguely okay. Will she
be able to stay on top of this once it gets moving?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He noticed she was wearing a new brown dress, but her short
hair was tangled, her face streaked with pain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The bastards. They must have worked her over, trying to find
out everything she knew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There were two &quot;representatives,&quot; Novosty had said.
So the other man was still in the limo, in the driver's seat, covering in case
there was trouble.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good move. Because there was definitely going to be trouble.
A lot of it. Tanzan Mino's goons were about to have all the trouble they could
handle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, oh, Christ.&quot; She finally recognized him.
&quot;Thank God. Just give them—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Can you understand what's going on here?&quot; He
raised his hand. &quot;These guys are <i>kobun</i>, professional hit men. They
have a very sick sense of humor. They also have no intention of—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Please, they have given me their word.&quot; Novosty
interrupted him, then glanced back. &quot;You can see she is well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She didn't look well at all. She seemed drugged, standing
shakily in the brilliant sunshine, a glazed stare from her eyes, hands twisting
at her skirt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Eva, Eva, he thought, what did they do to you? Whatever it
was, it worked. You look defeated, helpless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, just let them have the computer.&quot; She
spoke again, her voice quivering. &quot;They say it's all they want. Then
they'll—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Eva, it's all a lie. The big lie. So just lighten up
and enjoy this. We're not giving them so much as the time of day until they let
you go. First tell me, how badly did they rough you up? I want to know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, please.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You will be happy to learn that Dr. Michael Vance is a
specialist in international finance,&quot; Novosty interrupted, addressing the
tall Japanese. &quot;He has kindly offered to serve as my agent in completing
the final arrangements for the transfer of funds from London. He will resolve any
remaining difficulties. As I said, he is my agent, and it is important that he
not be harmed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alex, back off. I haven't agreed to anything.&quot;
Vance turned to the Japanese. &quot;How's the arm? Hope the damage wasn't
permanent.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where are the NSA materials.&quot; The man ignored
Vance's question. His voice was sharp and his English almost perfect.
&quot;That is our first order of business.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right here.&quot; He lifted the suitcase. &quot;I
assume we're all going to deal honorably for a change. Eva first, then we talk
about this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm sure Dr. Vance has brought everything you
want,&quot; Novosty added quickly, glancing over. &quot;Perhaps if he gave the
materials to you now, the woman could be released. Then he and I can proceed
immediately with the matter of the funds.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You are not involved,&quot; the Japanese snapped back.
&quot;We have been authorized to personally handle this breach of
security.&quot; He stared at Novosty. &quot;The funds, in fact, were your sole
responsibility. They were to have been transferred to Shokin Gaigoku Bank in
Tokyo over a week ago. You demanded an exorbitant commission, and you did not
deliver. Consequently you will return that commission and our London <i>oyabun </i>will
handle it himself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The <i>Mino-gumi</i> probably should have handled it in the
first place, Vance thought fieetingly. Alex was definitely out of his depth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just a couple of days more . . .&quot; Novosty went
pale. &quot;I thought I had explained—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your 'explanations' are not adequate.&quot; The man cut
him off, then pointed to the suitcase in Vance's hand. &quot;Now give us
that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why not.&quot; He settled the brown leather case onto
the asphalt. &quot;It's good business always to check out the merchandise, make
sure it's what you're paying for.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She said it was a portable computer.&quot; The man
walked over, then cradled the H&amp;K automatic in his bandaged arm while he
reached down to loosen the straps. Next he pulled the zipper around and laid
open the case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What is this?&quot; He lifted out the pile of printed
paper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Guess she forgot to tell you. We cracked the encryption.
I thought maybe you'd like to have a printed version, so I threw one in for
free.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stared at it a second, almost disbelieving, then looked
up. &quot;This is a photocopy. Where is the original?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Original? You mean that's not—?&quot; Vanced looked at
it. &quot;Gee, my mistake. Guess I must have left it somewhere. Sorry you had
to drive all the way out here from Athens for nothing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jesus, Michael,&quot; Eva blurted. &quot;Don't start
playing games with them. They'll—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I need all the copies.&quot; The man's voice hardened,
menacingly. &quot;Where are they?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't remember precisely. Tell you what, though. You
put her on a plane back to the States and maybe my recollection might start
improving.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We are wasting time.&quot; The door by the steering
wheel opened and the second <i>kobun </i>emerged, also carrying an automatic.
He was shorter, but the punch-perm hair and polyester suit appeared to have
come from standard issue, just like the sunglasses. He gestured his weapon
toward Vance. &quot;There is a simple way to improve your memory. You have
exactly ten seconds—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My friend, be reasonable,&quot; Novosty interrupted,
his voice still trying for calm. &quot;There are people here.&quot; He motioned
toward the crowd of gathering tourists. From their puzzled stares, they seemed
to be thinking they were witnessing a rehearsal for some Greek gangster film.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first man motioned his partner back, then turned to
Vance. &quot;You realize we will be forced to kill her right now if you don't
produce all originals and copies.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't really think you want to do that.&quot; Vance
stared at him. &quot;Because if anything happens to her, you're going to be
reading about your 'prototype' all over the American newspapers. I can probably
even swing some prime-time TV time for you. I'll take care of it
personally.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No one will believe you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't think so? My guess is the Washington Post will
run your entire protocol on page one. I'll see they get a very literal
translation into English. Then you won't need this. You can just buy all the
copies you want.&quot; He picked up the laptop and walked over to where Eva was
standing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Here, take this, and get back in the car, now. I think
these guys have got an attitude problem. So screw them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael.&quot; She reached for the computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Get in that one.&quot; He pointed toward Alex's gray
Saab. &quot;And take the next plane out of Greece. That place we talked about.
Anywhere. Just go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're getting nowhere,&quot; the second man barked
again. Then he leveled his automatic at Vance's right knee and clicked off the
safety. There was a gasp from the gawking tourists, and the crowd began
stumbling backward for cover. &quot;We have ways of extracting
information.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Oh, shit, he thought, whoa.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The man's voice suddenly trailed off, while a quizzical
expression spread through his eyes and a red spot appeared on his cheek. Next
his head jerked back and his automatic slammed against the car door, then
clattered across the asphalt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Not a second too soon, Vance thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No,&quot; Eva screamed, &quot;what's happening?&quot;
She lurched</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>backward,
then turned and stumbled for the Saab, carrying the computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first <i>kobun</i> glanced around, then raised the
H&amp;K in his left hand, trying to get a grip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'll hit the ground and roll, Vance thought, like any pro
under fire.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And he did exactly that, with a quick motion over onto his
back and then to his feet again, clicking off the safety as he came up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You want to kill us both?&quot; Vance was holding his
Llama now, trained on the sunglasses that had been crushed by the roll,
momentarily distorting the man's line of fire. &quot;Then go for it.&quot; He
squeezed the trigger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The walnut stock kicked slightly, but he just kept gripping
the satin chrome trigger. Now the gunman's automatic came around, its muzzle
erupting in flame. The crowd scattered, shouting in half a dozen languages,
terrified.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance just kept firing, dull thunks into the figure stumbling
backward as the H&amp;K machine pistol erupted spasmodically into the hot, dry
air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kill him, Michael. Oh, God! Yes. The bastards.&quot;
Eva was still yelling as she slammed shut the door of the Saab. Yelling,
cursing, screaming. Less than a second later the motor roared to life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Novosty was diving across the pavement, toward the open
front door of the limousine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, we've got to split up. Get out.&quot; He
yelled over his shoulder. &quot;I'll have to go to London now. There's nowhere
left. They're going to come for the money.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance scarcely heard him as he held the Llama steady and kept
on squeezing until the magazine was empty and only vacant clicks coursed
through his hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The screech of tires brought him back. He looked up to see
the white limousine careening along the edge of the road, barely avoiding the
ditch, its door still open, Novosty at the wheel. Eva was already gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He noticed that they'd removed the plates from the limousine,
just as he'd done on his rented Alfa. There would be nothing but terrified
tourists and two illegally armed, very dead Japanese hoods here when the Greek
police finally arrived. The story would come out in a babel of languages and be
totally inconsistent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Christ! he thought. It was supposed to be over by now, and
instead it's just beginning. When word of this gets back to Tokyo, life's going
to get very interesting, very fast. The <i>Mino-gumi </i>knows how to play for
keeps. We've got to blow this thing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Across, on the hot asphalt, the two Japanese were sprawled
askew, sunglasses crumpled. One body was bleeding profusely from the chest, the
other from a single, perfect hole in the cheek. The <i>kobun</i> who had come
within moments of removing his kneecaps now lay with a small hole in front of
one ear and the opposite side of the face half missing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What a shot!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But why did he wait so long? We had them in the clear. I see
now why the Greek Resistance scared hell out of . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Never look at the eyes, Michael.&quot; The voice
sounded from the boulders of the hillside above, where the muzzle of a World
War II German carbine, oiled and perfect, glinted. &quot;Remember I told you.
It gives you very bad dreams.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The massive hulk of <i>Daedalus I </i>was being towed slowly
through the hangar doors, now open to their full 250-foot span. As it rolled
out, the titanium-composite skin glistened in the fluorescent lights of the
hangar, then acquired a ghostly glow under the pale moonlight. First came the
pen-sharp nose containing the navigational gear, radar, and video cameras for
visible light and infrared; next the massive ramjet-scramjets, six beneath each
swept-back, blunt wing; and finally the towering tail assembly, twin vertical
stabilizers positioned high and outboard to avoid blanketing from the fuselage.
The tow-truck drivers and watching technicians all thought it was the most
beautiful creation they had ever seen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This would be Yuri Androv's last scheduled test flight before
he took the vehicle hypersonic. In four more days. He wore a full pressure suit
and an astronaut-style life-support unit rested next to him. As he finished
adjusting the cockpit seat, he monitored the roll-out on his liquid crystal
helmet screens, calling up the visual display that provided pre-takeoff and
line-up checks of the instruments. Not surprisingly, the numbers were
nominal—all hydraulic pressures stable, all temperatures ambient. As usual, the
Japanese technicians had meticulously executed their own preflight prep, poring
over the vehicle with their computerized checklists. Everything was in the
green.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All the same, this moment always brought a gut-tightening
blend of anticipation and fear. This was the part he dreaded most in any test
flight—when he was strapped in the cockpit but without operational control. He
lived by control, and this was one of the few times when he knew he had none.
It fed all the adrenaline surging through him, pressed his nerves to the limit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He flipped a switch under his hand and displayed the infrared
cameras on his helmet screens, then absently monitored the massive white trucks
towing him onto the darkened tarmac. The landing lights along the runway were
off; they would be switched on only for final approach, when, guided by the
radar installation, their focused beams would be invisible outside a
hundred-yard perimeter of the nose cameras.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The asphalt beneath him, swept by the freezing winds of
Hokkaido, was a special synthetic, carefully camouflaged. He knew it well. Two
nights earlier he'd come out here to have a talk with the project <i>kurirovat</i>,
Ivan Semenovich Lemontov, the lean and wily Soviet officer-in-charge. Formerly
that post had belonged to the CPSU's official spy, but now party control was
supposed to be a thing of the past. So what was he doing here?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whatever it was, the isolated landing strip had seemed the
most secure place for some straight answers. As they strolled in the moonlight,
the harsh gale off the straits cutting into their skin, he'd demanded Lemontov
tell him what was really going on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By the time they were finished, he'd almost wished he hadn't
asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yuri Andreevich, on this project you are merely the
test pilot. Your job is to follow orders.&quot; Lemontov had paused to light a
Russian cigarette, cupping his hands against the wind to reveal his thin,
foxlike face. He was a hardliner left over from the old days, and occasionally
it still showed. &quot;Strategic matters should not concern you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was brought in late, only four months ago, after the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>prototypes
were ready for initial flight testing. But if I'm flying the <i>Daedalus</i>,
then I want to know its ultimate purpose. The truth. Nobody's told me anything.
The only thing I'm sure of is that all the talk about near-space research is
bullshit. Which means I'm being used.&quot; He had caught Lemontov's arm and
drew him around. The officer's eyes were half hidden in the dark. &quot;Now,
dammit, I want to know what in hell is the real purpose of this vehicle.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Lemontov had grunted, then pulled away and drew on his
cigarette. Finally he spoke: &quot;Yuri Andreevich, sometimes it's wiser to
leave strategy to the professionals. You do your job and I'll do mine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yuri remembered how he'd felt his anger boil. He'd begun to
suspect that certain CPSU hardliners like Lemontov, together with the military
or the KGB, had their own plans for the vehicle. But what were they up to?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, I'm doing my job. So how about a little openness,
a little glasnost? This is not supposed to be like the old days.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Lemontov had drawn a few paces ahead on the tarmac, walking
briskly, with the quick energy that had brought him to his powerful party post.
Finally he'd slowed and waited for Yuri to catch up. He had made a decision and
he had made it quickly. That was characteristic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yuri Andreevich, in a way you represent part of our
'technology exchange' with Mino Industries. You have an indispensible role to
play here. This whole program depends on you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm well aware of that.&quot; However, it hadn't
answered his questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then you should also be aware of something else. This
undertaking is a small, but highly crucial, part of something much larger. Nothing
less than the fate of the Soviet Union in the next century rests on whether
Project Daedalus succeeds.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Yuri had watched him walk on,
feeling his own impatience growing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Lemontov had turned back again, brusquely. &quot;This hypersonic
spacecraft is the symbol, the flagship, of a new Soviet alliance with the most
technologically advanced nation on earth. Even a 'flyboy' like you should be
able to grasp that. Through this alliance we eventually will find a way to tap
all of Japan's new technology. The world of the future—advanced semiconductors,
robots, biotechnology, superconductivity, all of it—is going to be controlled
by Japan, and we must have access to it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yuri had listened in silence, once more feeling he was being
fed half-truths. Then Lemontov lowered his voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yuri Andreevich, by forming what amounts to a strategic
alliance with Mino Industries, we will achieve two objectives. We will gain
access to Japanese technology and capital, to rejuvenate Soviet industry and
placate our people. And we will strike a preemptive blow against the peril of a
new China on our borders in the next century.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;China?&quot; Yuri had studied him, startled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My friend, don't be fooled by summits and talks of
reconciliation. Neither we nor China care a kopeck about the other. Think about
it. In the long run, China can only be our nightmare. If America had to look
across its Canadian border and see China, they too would be terrified. China
has the numbers and, soon, the technology to threaten us. It's the worst
nightmare you or I could ever have.&quot; Lemontov had paused to crush out his
cigarette, grinding it savagely into the asphalt. &quot;We must prepare for it
now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The hardliners have just found a new enemy, Yuri had
realized. The Cold War lives!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Like it or not,&quot; Lemontov had continued, &quot;and
just between us I'm not sure I do like it, we have no choice but to turn to
Japan in order to have an ally in Asia to counter the new, frightening specter
of a hostile China rising up on our flank.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So how does <i>Daedalus </i>figure into all this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;As I said, it is the first step in our new
alliance. From now on our space programs will be united as one.&quot; He had
sighed into the icy wind. &quot;It will be our mutual platform for near-earth
space exploration.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;With only peaceful intent?&quot; Yuri had tried to
study his eyes, but the dark obscured them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've told you all you need to know.&quot; A match had
flared again as he lit another cigarette. In the tiny blaze of light he gave a
small wink. &quot;Even though the <i>Daedalus </i>could easily be converted to
a . . first-strike platform, we naturally have no intention of outfitting these
prototypes, or later production models, for any such purpose. The Japanese
would never agree.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What had he been saying? That the hardliners were planning to
seize the vehicles and retrofit them as first- strike bombers? Maybe even make
a preemptive strike against China? Were they planning to double-cross the Japanese?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What they didn't seem to realize was that these vehicles
didn't need to be retrofitted. <i>Daedalus </i>was already faster and more
deadly than any existing missile. It couldn't be shot down, not by America's
yet-to-be-built SDI, not by anything. And speed was only part of the story.
What about the vehicle's other capabilities?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He switched his helmet screens momentarily to the infrared
cameras in the nose and studied the runway. Infrared. Pure military. And that
was just the beginning. There also was phased-array radar and slit-scan radar,
both equipped for frequency hopping and &quot;squirt&quot; emissions to evade
detection. And how about the radar altimeter, which allowed subsonic
maneuvering at low altitudes, &quot;on the deck&quot;? Or the auxiliary fuel
capacity in the forward bay, which permitted long-distance sustained operation?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No &quot;space platform&quot; needed all this radar-evasive,
weapons-systems management capability. Or a hyper-accurate inertial navigation
system. Kick in the scramjets and <i>Daedalus </i>could climb a hundred
thousand miles straight up in seven minutes, reenter the lower atmosphere at
will, loiter over an area, kick ass, then return to the untouchable safety of
space. There was enough cruise missile capacity to take out fifty hardened
sites. It could perform troop surveillance, deploy commandos to any firefight
on the globe in two hours . . . you name it. He also suspected there was yet
another feature, even more ominous, which he planned to check out tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While the Soviet military was secretly drooling to get its
hands on this new bomber, sending the cream of Soviet propulsion engineers here
to make sure it worked, they already had been outflanked. Typical idiocy. What
they'd overlooked was that these two planes still belonged to Mino Industries,
and only Mino Industries had access to the high-temperature ceramics and
titanium composites required to build more. Tanzan Mino held all the cards. He
surely knew the capabilities of this plane. Everything was already in place.
Mino Industries now owned the ultimate weapon: they had built or subcontracted
every component. Was Lemontov such a dumb party hack he couldn't see that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All the more reason to get the cards on the table. And soon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So far the plan was on track. He had demanded that the
schedule be moved up, and Ikeda had reluctantly agreed. In four days Yuri
Androv would take <i>Daedalus </i>into the region of near space using liquid
hydrogen, the first full hypersonic test flight. And that's when he intended to
blow everybody's neat scenario wide open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He felt the fuselage shudder as the trucks disengaged from
the eyelets on the landing gear. Then the radio crackled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is control, <i>Daedalus I</i>. Do you read?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Daedalus I</i>. Preflight nominal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Verified. Engine oil now heated to thirty
degrees Celsius. Begin ignition sequence.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Check. <i>Daedalus I </i>starting engines.&quot; He
scanned through the instrument readings on his helmet screens, then slipped his
hand down the throttle quadrant and pushed the button on the left. He could
almost feel the special low-flashpoint JP-7—originally developed for the
high-altitude American SR-71 Blackbird—begin to flow from the wing tanks into
the twelve turboramjets, priming them. Then the ground crew engaged the engines
with their huge trolley-mounted starters. As the rpm began to surge, he
reminded himself he was carrying only 2,100,000 pounds of fuel and it would
burn fast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He switched his helmet screens to the priority-one display
and scanned the master instrument panel: white bars showing engine rpm, fuel
flow, turbine inlet temperature, exhaust temperature, oil pressure, hydraulics.
Then he cut back to the infrared cameras and glanced over the tarmac stretching
out in front of him. Since the American KH-12 satellite had passed twenty
minutes earlier, flight conditions should now be totally secure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For tonight's program he was scheduled to take the vehicle to
Mach 4, then terminate the JP-7 feeds in the portside outboard trident and let
those three engines &quot;unstart,&quot; after which he would manually switch
them to scramjet geometry, all the while controlling pitch and yaw with the
stability augmentation equipment. That would be the easy part. The next step
required him to manually switch them back to turboramjet geometry and initiate
restart. At sixty-three thousand feet. Forty minutes later he was scheduled to
have her back safely in the hangar chocks, skin cooling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nothing to it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He flipped his helmet screens back and looked over the
readouts one final time. Fuel pressure was stable, engine nozzle control
switches locked in Auto Alpha configuration, flaps and slats set to fifteen
degrees for max performance takeoff. He ran through the checklist on the
screen: &quot;Fuel panel, check. Radar altimeter index, set. Throttle quadrant,
auto lock.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The thrust required to take <i>Daedalus I </i>airborne was
less than that needed for a vertically launched space shuttle, since lift was
gained from the wings, but still he was always amazed by the G-forces the
vehicle developed on takeoff. The awesome power at his fingertips inspired a
very deceptive sense of security.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Chase cars in place, Yuri. You're cleared for taxi. <i>Ne
puzha, ne pera!&quot;</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He started to respond, thinking it was the computer.
But this time there was no computer. He'd deliberately shut it down. If he
couldn't get this damned samolyot off a runway manually, he had no hopes for
the next step. The voice was merely Sergei, in flight control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Power to military thrust.&quot; He paused, toes on the
brakes, and relished the splendid isolation, the pure energy at his command as <i>Daedalus</i>
began to quiver. Multibillions at his fingertips, the most advanced . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Fuck it. This was the fun part.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Brake release.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In full unstick, he rammed the heavy handles on the throttle
quadrant to lock, commanding engines to max afterburner, and grinned ear to ear
as the twelve turboramjets screamed instantly to a million pounds of thrust,
slamming him against the cockpit supports.</span></p>

color:windowtext'>&quot;We are now cruising at twenty-nine thousand feet.
However, the captain has requested all passengers to please remain seated, with
their seat belts fastened.&quot; The female voice faltered as the plane dropped
through another air pocket. &quot;We may possibly be experiencing mild
turbulence for the next hour.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Michael Vance wanted a drink, for a lot of reasons. However,
the service in first class was temporarily suspended, since attendants on the
British Airways flight to London were themselves strapped into the flip-down
seats adjacent to the 757's galley. The turbulence was more than
&quot;mild.&quot; What lay ahead, in the skies and on the sea below, was
nothing less than a major storm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why not, he sighed? Everything else in the last four days had
gone wrong. He'd been shot at, he'd killed a mobster, and Eva had been
kidnapped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Furthermore, the drive back to Athens, then down to the port
of Piraeus to put Zeno onto the overnight ferry to Crete, had been a rain-swept
nightmare. Yet another storm had blown up from the Aegean, engulfing the coast
and even the mountains. When they finally reached the docks at Piraeus, the old
Greek had just managed to slip onto the boat as it was pulling out, his German
rifle wrapped in a soggy bundle of clothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, I must hurry.&quot; He kissed Vance on both
cheeks. &quot;Be safe.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You too.&quot; He took his hand, then passed him the
Llama, half glad to be rid of it and half wondering whether he might need it
again. &quot;Here, take this. And lose it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's final resting place will be in the depths of our
wine dark sea, my friend.&quot; Zeno pocketed it without a glance. &quot;No one
will ever know what we had to do, not even Adriana. But we failed. She is still
gone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't worry. I'll find her. And thank you again, for
saving my life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You would have done the same for me. Now hurry. The
airport. Perhaps there's still time to catch her.&quot; With a final embrace he
disappeared into the milling throng of rain-soaked travelers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The downpour was letting up, but the trip still took almost
an hour. When he finally pulled in at the aging Eastern terminal, he'd left the
car in the first space he could find and raced in. It was bedlam now, with
flights backed up by the storm, but he saw no sign of Eva. Where was she? Had
she even come here?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Planes had just started flying again. According to the huge
schedule board over the center of the floor, the first departure was a British
Air to Heathrow, leaving in five minutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was no chance of getting through passport control
without a ticket, so he'd elbowed his way to the front of the British Airways
desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That flight boarding. Three-seventy-one. I want a
seat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm sorry, sir, but you'll have to wait—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just sell me a ticket, dammit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The harried agent barely looked up. &quot;I'm afraid that's
out of the question. Now if you'll just take—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's a woman who may be on it,&quot; he lifted up
the empty leather suitcase, &quot;and she left this at the hotel.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The equipment is already preparing to leave the
gate.&quot; He glanced at the screen, then turned to a pile of tickets he was
methodically sorting. &quot;So if you'd please—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me check the manifest.&quot; He'd stepped over the
baggage scale, nudging the agent aside. &quot;To make double sure she's aboard.
Maybe I can try and locate her in London.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sir!&quot; The young Englishman paled. &quot;You're not
allowed to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just take a second.&quot; Vance ignored his protest and
punched up the flight on the computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was a 757, completely full. And there she was, in seat
18A, second cabin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thank God she'd made it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While the outraged British Airways agent was frantically
calling for airport security, he scanned more of the file.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alex Novosty was aboard too. In the very last row. Christ!
He'd even used his own name. His mind must be totally blown.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Did she know? Did he know? What now?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With the ticket agent still yelling, he'd quickly disappeared
into the crowd, having no choice but to pace a departure lounge for an hour and
a half, then take the only remaining London flight of the evening. All right,
he'd thought after cooling down, Novosty wants to use you; maybe you can use
him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But now he suspected things weren't going to be that simple.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He remembered the two KGB operatives Alex had shot and killed
at Knossos. They'd been there to find Eva, which meant they knew she had
something. Now he realized that wasn't all they knew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Across the aisle in first class sat a tall, willowy woman who
radiated all the self-confidence of a seasoned European traveler. She was also
elegantly beautiful—with dark eyes, auburn hair, and pursed red lips—and she
carried a large brown leather purse, Florentine. She could have been a French
fashion model, a high-paid American cosmetics executive, a Spanish diplomat's
mistress.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The problem was, Vance knew, she was none of those things.
The French passport he'd seen her brandish at the Greek behind the glass
windows at emigration control was a forgery. She was neither French, nor
American, nor Spanish. She was an executive vice president with Techmashimport,
the importing cover for T-Directorate. KGB.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vera Karanova was always a prominent presence at</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Western
trade shows. But there was no trade show in London now, no new high-tech toys
to be dangled before the wondering eyes of Techmashimport, which routinely arranged
to try and obtain restricted computers, surveillance gear, weapons-systems
blueprints.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So why's Comrade Karanova on this flight? Off to buy a
designer dress at a Sloane Street boutique? Catch the latest West End musical?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How about the simplest answer of all: She's going to help
them track Alex Novosty to earth. Or grab Eva. Or both. They're about to
tighten the noose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So the nightmare was still on. The KGB must have had the
airport under surveillance, and somebody spotted Novosty—or was it Eva?—getting
on the British Air flight to London. Now they were closing in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Does she know me? Vance wondered. My photo's in their files
somewhere, surely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But she'd betrayed no hint of recognition. So maybe not. He'd
always worked away from the limelight as much as possible. Once more it had
paid off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the plane dipped and shuddered from the turbulence, he
watched out of the corner of his eye as she lifted the fake French passport out
of her open leather handbag, now nestled in the empty seat by the window, and
began copying the number onto her landing card.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Very unprofessional, he thought. You always memorize the
numbers on a forgery. First rule. T-Directorate's getting sloppy these days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He waited till she'd finished, then leaned over and ran his
hand roughly down the arm of her blue silk blouse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Etes-vous aller a Londres pour du commerce</i>?&quot;
He deliberately made his French as American-accented as possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Comment</i>?&quot; She glanced up, annoyed, and
removed his hand. &quot;<i>Excusez moi, que dites-vous</i>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>D'affaires</i>?&quot; He grinned and craned to look
at the front of her open neckline. &quot;Business?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Oui</i> . . . yes.&quot; She switched quickly to
English, her relief almost too obvious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Get over there often?&quot; He pushed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;From time to time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No fooling, lady. You've been in London four times since '88,
by actual count, setting up phony third-party pass-through deals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just business, huh?&quot; He grinned again, then looked
up at the liquor service being unveiled in the galley. The turbulence had
subsided slightly and the attendants were trying to restore normality, at least
in first class. &quot;What do you say to a drink?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She beckoned the approaching steward, hoping to outflank this
obnoxious American across the aisle. &quot;Vodka and tonic, please.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Same as the lady's having, pal.&quot; He gave the young
Englishman a wink and a thumbs-up sign, then turned back. &quot;By the way, I'm
booked in at the Holiday Inn over by Marble Arch. Great room service. Almost
like home. You staying around there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No.&quot; She watched the steward pour her drink.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sorry to hear that. I was wondering, maybe we . . . Do
these 'business' trips of yours include taking some time off? Let you in on a
secret, just between you and me. I know this little club in Soho where they
have live—&quot; he winked, &quot;I got a membership. Tell you one thing,
there's nothing like it in Chicago.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm afraid I'll be busy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Too bad.&quot; He drew on his drink, then continued.
&quot;Long stay this trip?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you'll excuse me, Mr. —&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Warner. William J. Warner. Friends call me Bill.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Warner, I've had a very trying day. So, if you
don't mind, I'd like to attempt to get some rest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sure. You make yourself comfortable, now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He watched as she shifted to the window seat, as far as
possible from him, and stationed her leather handbag onto the aisle side. Just
then the plane hit another air pocket, rattling the liquor bottles in the
galley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe we'll catch up with each other in London,&quot;
he yelled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Most unlikely.&quot; She glared as she gulped the last
of her drink, then carefully rotated to the window and adjusted her seat to
full recline. Her face disappeared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Good riddance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After that the flight went smoothly for a few minutes, and
Michael Vance began to worry. But then the turbulence resumed, shutting down
drink service as their puny airplane again became a toy rattle in the hands of
the gods, thirty thousand feet over the Mediterranean, buffeted by the
powerful, unseen gusts of a spring storm. For a moment he found himself envying
Zeno, who had only the churning sea to face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Almost hesitantly he unbuckled his seat belt and pulled
himself up, balancing with one hand as he reached in the air to grapple
drunkenly with the overhead baggage compartment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sir,&quot; the steward yelled down the aisle, &quot;I'm
sorry, but you really must remain—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Take it easy, chum. I just need to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Another burst of turbulence slammed the wings, tossing the
cabin in a sickening lurch to the left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He lunged backward, flinging his hand around to catch the
leather purse and sweep it, upended, onto the floor. With a clatter the
contents sprayed down the aisle. Comrade Karanova popped alert, reaching out
too late to try and grab it. Her eyes were shooting daggers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ho, sorry about that. Damned thing just . . . Here, let
me try and . . .&quot; He bent over, blocking her view as he began sweeping up
the contents off the carpeted aisle— cosmetics, keys, and documents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The name in the passport was Helena Alsace. Inside the
boarding packet was a hotel reservation slip issued by an Athens travel agent.
The Savoy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, well, well. Looks like T-Directorate travels first
class everywhere these days. Learning the ways of the capitalist West.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Here you go. Never understood why women carry so much
junk in their purse.&quot; He was settling the bag back onto the seat.
&quot;Sure am sorry about that. Maybe I can buy you dinner to make amends. Or
how about trying out that room service I told you about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That will not be necessary, Mr. Warner.&quot; She
reached for the bag.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, just in case I'm in the neighborhood, what hotel
you staying at?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Connaught,&quot; she answered without a blink.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Great. I'll try and make an excuse to catch you
there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Please, just let me . . .&quot; She leaned back again,
arms wrapped around her purse, and firmly closed her eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Savoy, he thought again. Just my luck. That's where /
always stay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=bookmark33><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, I can't tell you how happy I am to hear from
you, old man. We must have lunch today.&quot; The voice emerged from the
receiver in the crisp diction of London's financial district, the City, even
though the speaker had been born on the opposite side of the globe. Vance
noticed it betrayed a hint of unease. &quot;Are you by any chance free around
noon? We could do with a chat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think I can make it.&quot; He took a sip of coffee
from the Strand Palace's cheap porcelain cup on the breakfast cart and leaned
back. He'd known the London financial scene long enough to understand what the
invitation meant. Lunch, in the private upstairs dining rooms of the City's
ruling merchant banks, was the deepest gesture of personal confidence. It was a
ritual believed to have the magical power to engender trust and
cooperation—cementing a deal, stroking an overly inquisitive journalist,
soothing a recalcitrant Labor politician. &quot;We had him to lunch&quot; often
substituted for a character reference in the City, a confirmation that the
individual in question had passed muster.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Superb.&quot; Kenji Nogami was trying hard to sound
British. &quot;What say you pop round about one-ish? I'll make sure my table is
ready.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, can we meet somewhere outside today? Anywhere but
at the bank.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Pleasure not business, Michael? But that's how business
works in this town, remember? It masquerades as pleasure. We 'new boys' have to
have our perks these days, just like the 'old boys.'&quot; He laughed.
&quot;Well then, how about that ghastly pub full of public-school jobbers down
by the new Leadenhall Market. Know it? We could pop in for a pint. Nobody you
or I know would be caught dead drinking there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Across from that brokers club, right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the one. It's bloody loud at lunch, but we can
still talk.&quot; Another laugh. &quot;Matter of fact, I might even be asking a
trifling favor of you, old man. So you'd best be warned.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's a small favor between enemies. See you at
one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;On the dot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he cradled the receiver and poured the last dregs of
caffeine into his cup, he listened to the blare of horns on the Strand and
wondered what was wrong with the conversation that had just ended. Simple:
Kenji Nogami was too quick and chipper. Which meant he was worried. Why? These
days he should be on top of the world. He'd just acquired a controlling
interest in the Westminster Union Bank, one of the top ten merchant banks in
the City, after an unprecedented hostile takeover. Was the new venture suddenly
in trouble?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Not likely. Nogami had brought in a crackerjack Japanese team
and dragged the bank kicking and screaming into the lucrative Eurobond business,
the issuing of corporate debentures in currencies other than that of a company's
home country. Eurocurrencies and Eurobonds now moved in wholesale amounts
between governments, central banks, and large multinational firms. The trading
of Eurobonds was centered in London, global leader in foreign exchange dealing,
and they represented the world's largest debt market. In addition, Nogami had
aggressively stepped up Westminster Union's traditional merchant bank
operations by financing foreign trade, structuring corporate finance deals, and
underwriting new issues of shares and bonds. He also excelled in the new game
of corporate takeovers. None of the major London merchant bankers—the
Rothschilds, Schroders, Hambros, Barings— had originally been British, so maybe
Kenji was merely following in the footsteps of the greats. Vance did know he
was a first-class manager, a paragon of Japanese prudence here in the new
booming, go-go London financial scene.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This town used to be one of Michael Vance's sentimental
favorites, a living monument to British dignity, reserve, fair play. But today
it was changing fast. After the Big Bang, London had become a prisoner of the
paper prosperity of its money changers, who'd been loosed in the Temple. Thanks
to them the City, that square mile comprising London's old financial center,
would never again be the same. After the Big Bang, the City had become a
bustling beehive of brash, ambitious young men and women whose emblem,
fittingly, seemed to be the outrageous new headquarters Lloyds had built for
itself, a monstrous spaceship dropped remorselessly into the middle of Greek
Revival facades and Victorian respectability. It was, to his mind, like
watching the new money give the finger to the old. The staid headquarters of
the Bank of England up the way, that grand Old Lady of Threadneedle Street, now
seemed a doddering dowager at a rock concert.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All the same, he liked to stay near the City, close to the
action. The Savoy, a brisk ten-minute walk from the financial district, was his
usual spot, but since that was out of the question this time, he'd checked into
the refurbished Strand Palace, just across the street.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Today he had work to do. He had to get word to the <i>Mino-gumi
</i>to back off. And he was tired of dealing with lieutenants and enforcers, <i>kobun</i>.
The time had come to go to the top, the Tokyo <i>oyabun</i>. The game of cat
and mouse had to stop. Tokyo knew how to make deals. It was time to make one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kenji Nogami, he figured, was just the man. Nogami, a wiry
executive with appropriately graying hair and a smile of granite, was a
consummate tactician who'd survived in the global financial jungle for almost
three decades. When the Japanese finally got tired of the British financial
club playing school tie and bowler hats and &quot;old boy&quot; with them,
shutting them out, they'd picked Nogami to handle the hostile takeover of one
of the pillars of London's merchant banking community. Japan might still be
afraid to go that route with the Americans, who loved to rattle protectionist
sabers, but England didn't scare them a whit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In years gone by, such attempts to violate British class
privilege were squelched by a few of the Eton grads of the City chipping in to
undermine the hostile bid. These days, however, nobody had the money to scare off
Japan. The game was up. And after the deregulation of Big Bang, wholesale
pursuit of profit had become the City's guiding principle. Unfortunately, that
turned out to be a game Kenji Nogami and his Shokin Gaigoku Bank could play
better than anybody in the world. Nogami saw himself as an advance man for the
eventual Japanese domination of the globe's financial landscape. Maybe he was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Michael Vance knew him from a wholly different direction, now
almost another life. In years gone by, Nogami had traveled with equal ease in
two worlds—that of straight money and that of &quot;hot&quot; money. He'd
always maintained the cover of a legitimate banker, but insiders knew he'd made
his real fortune laundering Yakuza amphetamine receipts and importing
small-caliber weapons. It was that second career that now made him the perfect
pipeline for a message that needed to be delivered fast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance finished off the last of the coffee in his cup, then
rose and strolled to the window to gaze down on the bustling Strand. The
weather looked murky, typical for London.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Where was Eva now? he wondered. What was she doing? Maybe
she'd managed to lose Novosty and get back to thinking about the protocol.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, he had some pressing business of his own, but the first
thing was to try and find her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe she was wondering right now how to get in touch with
him. What places here had they been together, back in the old days? Maybe there
was some location . . . the V&amp;A? St. Pauls? or how about a restaurant? What
was that one she'd loved so much? The place the IRA shot up a few years back?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment the white phone beside his bed interrupted his
thoughts with its insistent British double chirp. He whirled around, startled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Who knew he was here? If it was the KGB, or the Japanese mob,
they wouldn't bother ringing for an appointment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally, after the fifth burst, he decided to reach for it.
Probably just the desk, calling about the breakfast things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The voice was the last one he expected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hello, darling.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Eva!&quot; He almost shouted. &quot;Where the hell are
you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You really must stop shooting people, you know,&quot;
she lectured. &quot;You're getting to be a horrible menace to society.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael.&quot; The voice hardened. &quot;Christ, what a
mess.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you okay?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, I think so.&quot; She paused to inhale. &quot;But
I'm literally afraid to move. I think KGB got Alex, there in Terminal Four at
Heathrow. He was trying to bluff them, though, so maybe he pulled it off.
Anyway, they were so tied up I just slipped past.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The hell with him. Where are—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't dare take a step outside this room now. Let's
meet tonight. Besides, I want to work on translating . . . you know. I rang a
scholarly bookshop I used to order from and they're delivering one of Ventris's
books. Maybe I can make some headway.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I already did a bit of it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I saw that in the files. A whole page.&quot; She
laughed. &quot;Congratulations.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Give me a break. It's been ten years.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, it looks like you're still able to fake the
scholar bit. But just barely.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thanks. What do you think of it so far?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Scary. Very scary. But we have to do more. Enough so we
can go public.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Exactly. Look, I've got to do a couple of things today.
Can you—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's fine, because I want to work on this.&quot; She
sounded businesslike again, her old self. &quot;Something to while away the
empty hours. The saga inside my little Zenith has got to be the ticket out of
this madness.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe, but we need to put some more spin on the
scenario. Just to be safe.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not on the phone. Can you just sit tight? Play your
game and let me take a shot at mine?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It better be good.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That remains to be seen.&quot; Who knew how it would
go? But if it proceeded as planned, the whole thing could be turned around.
&quot;Now where the hell are you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The place we always stayed, of course. Figuring you'd
come here. But you stood me up, naturally. Same old Michael. So this morning I
started calling around.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean you're—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=bookmark35><b><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tanzan Mino was dressed in a black three-quarter sleeved
kimono, staring straight ahead as he knelt before the sword resting in front of
him. His hands were settled lightly on his thighs, his face expressionless.
Then he reached out and touched the scabbard, bowing low to it. Inside was a
twelfth-century katana, a five-foot-long razor created by swordsmiths of the
Mino School, from the town of Seki, near Gifu in the heart of old Honshu. It
was, he believed, a perfect metaphor for Japanese excellence and discipline.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The sword had now been reverenced; next he would use it to
test his own centering. At this moment his mind was empty, knowing nothing,
feeling nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As his torso drew erect, he grasped the upper
portion of the scabbard with his right hand, its tip with his left, and pulled
it around to insert it into the black sash at his waist. He sat rigid for a
moment, poised, then thrust his right foot forward as he simultaneously grasped
the hilt of the sword with his right hand, the upper portion of the scabbard
with his left. In a lightning move he twisted the hilt a half-turn and drew the
blade out and across, his right foot moving into the attack stance. The whip of
steel fairly sang through the empty air as the sword and his body moved
together. It was the <i>chudan no kamae </i>stroke, the tip of the blade thrust
directly at an opponent's face, an exercise in precision, balance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Rising to a half kneel, he next lifted the sword above his
head, his left hand moving up to seize the hilt in a powerful two-handed grip.
An instant later he slashed downward with fierce yet controlled intensity,
still holding the hilt at arm's length. It was the powerful <i>jodan no kamae</i>
stroke, known to sever iron.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally, holding the hilt straight in front of him, he rotated
the blade ninety degrees, then pulled his left hand back and grasped the mouth
of the scabbard. As he rose to both feet, he raised the sword with his right
hand and touched its <i>tsuba </i>handguard to his forehead in silent reverence,
even as he shifted the scabbard forward. Then in a single motion he brought the
blade around and caught it with his left hand just in front of the guard, still
holding the scabbard. With ritual precision he guided the blade up its full
length, until the tip met the opening of the sheath, and then he slowly slipped
it in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This weapon, he reflected with pride, was crafted of the
finest steel the world had ever seen, created by folding and hammering heated
layers again and again until it consisted of hundreds of thousands of
paper-thin sheets. The metallurgy of Japan had been unsurpassed for eight
hundred years, and now the <i>Daedalus </i>spaceplane had once again reaffirmed
that superiority. Building on centuries of expertise, he had succeeded in
fashioning the heretofore-un known materials necessary to withstand the intense
heat of scramjet operation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The remaining problems now lay in another direction entirely.
The difficulty was not technology; it was human blundering. Lack of discipline.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Discipline. The news he had just received had only served to
assure him once again that discipline was essential in all of life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he turned and stationed the sword across his desk, he
surveyed his penthouse domain and understood why heads of state must feel such
isolation, such impotence. You could have the best planning, the best organization,
the tightest coordination, and yet your fate still rode on luck and chance. And
on others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Overall, however, the scenario possessed an inescapable
inevitability. A lifetime of experience told him he was right. He glanced at
the sword one last time, again inspired by it, and settled himself at the desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tanzan Mino was known throughout Japan as a <i>kuromaku</i>,
a man who made things happen. Named after the unseen stagehand who pulled the
wires in Japanese theater, manipulating the stage and those on it from behind a
black curtain, the <i>kuromaku</i> had been a fixture in Japanese politics
since the late nineteenth century. He fit the classic profile perfectly: He was
an ultranationalist who coordinated the interests of the right-wing underworld
with the on-stage players in industry and politics. In this role, he had risen
from the ruins of World War II to become the most powerful man in Asia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It had been a long and difficult road. He'd begun as an Osaka
street operator in the late thirties, a fervent nationalist and open admirer of
Mussolini who made his followers wear black shirts in imitation of the Italian
fascists. When the Pacific War began, he had followed the Japanese army into
Shanghai where, under the guise of procuring &quot;strategic materials&quot;
for the imperial Navy, he trafficked in booty looted from Chinese warehouses
and operated an intelligence network for the Kempei Tai, the Japanese secret
police. After Japan lost China, and the war, the occupying supreme commander
for the allied powers (SCAP) labeled him a Class A war criminal and handed him
a three-year term in Sugamo prison.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The stone floors and hunger and rats gave him the incentive
to plan for better things. The ruins of Japan, he concluded, offered enormous
opportunity for men of determination. The country would be rebuilt, and those
builders would rule.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thus it was that while still in Sugamo he set about devising
the realization of his foremost ambition: to make himself oyabun of the Tokyo
Yakuza. His first step, he had decided, would be to become Japan's gambling
czar, and upon his release—he was thirty years old at the time—he had made a
deal with various local governments to organize speedboat races and split the
take on the accompanying wagering. It was an offer none chose to refuse, and
over the next forty years he and his <i>Mino-gumi </i>Yakuza amassed a fortune
from the receipts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While still in Sugamo prison he had yet another insight: That
to succeed in the New Japan it would be necessary to align himself temporarily
with the globe's powerful new player, America. Accordingly he began cultivating
connections with American intelligence, and upon his release, he landed a job
as an undercover agent for the occupation's G-2 section, Intelligence. He'd
specialized in black- bag operations for the Kempei Tai in Shanghai during the
war, so he had the requisite skills.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When SCAP's era of reconstruction wound down, he thoughtfully
offered his services to the CIA, volunteering to help them crush any new
Japanese political movements that smacked of leftism. It was love at first
sight, and soon Tanzan Mino was fronting for the Company, putting to good use
his <i>Mino-gumi </i>Yakuza as strikebreakers. With Tanzan Mino as <i>kuromaku</i>,
the Yakuza and the American CIA had run postwar Japan during the early years,
keeping it safe for capitalism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then as prosperity returned, new areas of expansion beckoned.
When goods could again be bought openly, the black market, long a Yakuza
mainstay, began to wither away. But he had converted this into an opportunity,
stepping in to fill the new Japanese consumer's need for cash by opening
storefront loan services known as <i>sarakin</i>. Although his Yakuza charged
interest rates as high as 70 percent, the average Japanese could walk into a
side-street office and minutes later walk out with several thousand dollars, no
questions asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Unlike banks, he didn't bother with credit checks—he had
well-proven collection techniques—and before long his <i>sarakin </i>were
handling more consumer loans than all Japan's banks combined. His success was
such that foreign bankers wanting to gain a foothold in Japan soon started
coming to him. Bank of America, Bankers Trust, Chase Manhattan, American
Express Bank—all began placing capital wholesale through the Yakuza's <i>sarakin</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When the CIA bankrolled the Corsican mob as strikebreakers
in Marseilles in the fifties, they were merely financing heroin labs for the
French Connection, but when they and America's leading banks hired on with
Tanzan Mino's Yakuza, they were furthering the career of the man destined to
become the world's richest right-winger. The CIA arrangement had lasted until a
midlevel field consultant blew the whistle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The score for that had yet to be settled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He shrugged away the thought with a glimmer of anger and
turned to study the column of green figures on the computer screen atop his
desk, mentally running a total. The numbers, at least, pleased him.
Capitalization for the first year was ready to be issued; the dummy
corporations were in place, their paperwork impeccable. None of the financing
packages was likely to raise eyebrows. The plan was as flawless as human
ability could make it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the pale light of dusk crept through the blinds, laying
faint shadows across his silver hair, he reached over with a smile and touched
the white stingray-skin binding on the sword's hilt. Yes, the plan was
brilliant. A third world war, one of economics, had begun, but none of the
other combatants fully realized it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The European trading nations of 1992 were banding together,
also bringing in the new capitalists of Eastern Europe, to create a trade
monolith. At the same time Japan had, through strategic planning, achieved its
own Pacific trade bloc, finally realizing its aim during the war, a Greater
East Asia Coprosperity Sphere. Now only one final target remained: the new
consumers of the Soviet Union, who represented the world's largest untapped
market for goods, technology, investment. The Europeans, the Americans, all the
capitalists, were fighting for that prize, but Tanzan Mino was within a whisker
of seizing it for Japan and Mino Industries. The Soviets would have no choice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He reached down to stroke Neko, the snow leopard who slept
beside his desk, and reflected on the scenario. The Soviets had bought into it
with eyes open. The plan was turning out to be absurdly easy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At the moment all he needed was the cleanly laundered payoff
money. The political risks, the financial risks, everything had to be covered.
The powers in the Liberal Democratic Party feared going out on a limb for such
a risky strategic objective. They required encouragement. And certain prominent
Japanese bankers, who would have to assist in the scenario, also needed
inducement. But the money had to be cash and totally untraceable. No more
Recruit-style fiascos.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Where was it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He pushed that worry aside momentarily as he studied the
gleaming model of the <i>Daedalus</i>, poised like a Greek statue in the center
of his office. To think that the Soviets would agree not only to the hard
financial and territorial terms he had demanded, but actually were willing to
help Mino Industries develop the most advanced airplane the world had ever
seen. Their plight was fully as desperate as he'd assumed. It was a game where
he won everything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, the <i>Daedalus </i>was as important as all the rest combined.
It would leapfrog Japan to the undisputed ranks of the major powers, erasing
forever the distinction between civilian and military technology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Still, though, there were problems. Always problems. First,
the news he had just received: The laundered funds still had not been
delivered. Then there was the matter of the NSA cryptographer who had been
given an intercepted copy of the protocol. Three men had been lost attempting
to retrieve it, but she remained at large. That was unacceptable. It had to be
reclaimed, no matter the cost, lest there be a premature exposure of the plan.
Timing was everything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Added to that was the puzzling matter of the Soviet test
pilot, on whom the fate of the entire project hinged. He'd begun making
outrageous demands, insisting on moving up the first hypersonic flight to
Friday. Why? He'd once spent time in the United States as an exchange pilot.
Could he be fully trusted?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tanzan Mino had finally, reluctantly, approved the schedule
change, though his instincts told him to beware. His instincts rarely failed,
but it was better not to appear too inflexible too soon. At this stage the test
pilot had become the crucial component of the project. Sometimes you had to
bend to get what you wanted, and instincts be damned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As if all that were not enough, he'd just heard an unsettling
rumble out of London concerning Kenji Nogami, a <i>Mino-gumi kobun </i>for
thirty years, a man he'd made rich.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He turned his attention back to the computer screen
and studied the numbers once more. However, he could not concentrate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The problems. He felt his anger rise, unbidden. He was too
old for problems. Surmounting human incompetence was a young man's game. He
had, he told himself, struggled enough for a dozen men. And now, having
dedicated himself to fashioning Japan's twenty-first century ascendancy, he no
longer really cared about money. No, what mattered now was the triumph of the
Japanese people, the emperor, the Yamato spirit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His countrymen, he had always believed, shared a noble
heritage with another race, one distant in time and place but brothers still.
Both the modern Japanese and the ancient Greeks had pursued a mission to refine
the civilizations around them, offering a powerful vision of human
possibilities. They both were unique peoples chosen by the gods. He wanted,
more than anything, for the entire world to at last understand that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With a sigh he turned and gave Neko a loving pat on her
spotted muzzle, then touched the buzzer on his desk. Time to start solving the
problems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, I'm terribly glad you could make it.&quot;
Kenji Nogami smiled and reached for his pint of amber-colored lager. His
tailoring was Savile Row via Bond Street, his accent Cambridge, his background
well concealed. In a business where appearances counted for much, he had all
the careful touches that separated the players from the pretenders—cheeks sleek
from a daily workout at his club, eyes penetrating and always alert, hair
graying at the temples. Today he stood out like a beacon in the mob of chatting
brokers and jobbers in the paneled gloom of the pub, his aloof bearing and dark
pinstripe suit proclaiming INSIDER as clearly as neon. A Japanese to the core,
he still looked as though he had belonged there for a hundred years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By the way, congratulations on the takeover.&quot;
Vance caught the pint of ale sliding across the beer-soaked mahogany, then
lifted it. &quot;I hear you scared hell out of the big players here in the
City. Here's to going straight. Hope it doesn't take all the fun out of
life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It had to happen eventually, Michael.&quot; He nodded
with innocent guile and raised his glass tankard in return. &quot;Cheers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;To your health and wealth.&quot; Vance joined him in a
sip. It was warm and bitter, the way he liked it. &quot;No more intrigue.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well . . . He winked and drank again, blowing back the
foam. &quot;We bankers still thrive on intrigue, old man. And secrecy.
Otherwise somebody else would start making the money.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The young brokers laughing, smoking, and drinking in the pub
all looked as though they made buckets of money. Outside, the ocher-trimmed
Doric columns of the refurbished Leadenhall Market looked down on the lunchtime
crowds of the financial district, almost all men in white shirts and dark
suits, the modern uniform of the money changer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Trouble with secrets, though&quot;—Vance settled his
mug onto the wet bar and looked up—&quot;is that eventually the word gets
out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nogami studied him. &quot;Are you hinting at something?
Something I should know?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe I'm just thinking out loud. But what if a guy
like me came across some proprietary information, sort of by accident, and
consequently an old friend of ours back home in Tokyo was very unhappy?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If that 'friend' is who I think you mean, he's not someone
either of us wants to see unhappy, do we?&quot; He sipped solemnly at his beer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Speak for yourself,&quot; Vance replied, and drank
again. &quot;But to continue, what if this hypothetical guy had decided to try
and simplify the situation, get news back to Tokyo about a way to solve
everybody's problem? Then he'd need an information conduit. One that's tried
and true.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nogami reached for a tray of peanuts, took a small handful
and shook them in his fist before popping one into his mouth. He chewed for a
second, then smiled. &quot;One way might be to have a drink with an old, shall
we say, acquaintance, in hopes he might be able to help with some communication.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sounds like we're making headway here.&quot; He paused.
&quot;Say this hypothetical guy wants to talk a deal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What sort of deal?&quot; Nogami chewed on more peanuts,
his eyes noncommittal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;For instance, if Tokyo'll lay off, he'll see what he
can do about some laundered funds our friend's been waiting for. He's in a
position to make it happen. But if they keep on with the muscle, the deal's
off. In other words, no play, no pay.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Supposing I know the individual in Tokyo you mean, as
things stand now you've quite possibly come to the wrong man.&quot; He sighed.
&quot;This isn't the old days, my friend. I'm not wired in like I used to be.
Times have changed, thank God. I'm out. I run an honest merchant bank, at least
as honest as you can in this new day and age. And I like it that way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, don't start the runaround.&quot; Vance tried to
keep his tone easy. &quot;You're not talking to some bank examiner now. In
Japan connections last forever. We both know that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You were never more correct.&quot; Nogami examined his
lager. &quot;Obligations remain, even though influence wanes. Which is, in
fact, one of the reasons I wanted to see you today. Michael, if I do you this
favor, could you perhaps do one for me in return?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is it legit?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I suppose that depends,&quot; he laughed. &quot;Look,
of course I'd be more than happy to send a secure telex, if that's all you
want. Heaven knows I owe you that much.&quot; He paused to sip from his mug.
&quot;But I'll sound rather a fool if I don't know the first thing about the
situation. Can't you at least give me some idea?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tokyo'll understand. And the less you know, the better
for everybody.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right. But my position right now is . . . well, I
may not be able to help as much as I'd like.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't like the sound of that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's the problem I mentioned to you. That 'individual'
is calling in favors with me now, not the other way around. So this could be a
trifle awkward, if you see what I mean.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, have you forgot I took care of you once? Remember
the Toshiba milling-machine sale to the Soviets? All the posturing back in the
U.S.? It could have been a lot worse for your team politically. Afterwards you
said you owed me one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, and I still appreciate what you did, tipping me
off about the French, the fact they'd already sold such machines to the Soviets
years ago. It helped us dampen the fires of moral indignation on Capitol
Hill.&quot; He took another sip. &quot;I got a lot of points with the right
people in the LDP.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I just got fed up with all the bullshit. No harm
done.&quot; He leaned back. &quot;But now it's your turn.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Fair enough.&quot; He gazed around the crowded, smoke-
filled pub. &quot;Michael, I don't know if we really should be talking here.
Care to take a walk, down to the Thames? Get a bit of air. Maybe hope for some
sunshine?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right.&quot; Vance tossed down a five-pound note
and reached for his overcoat, draped across the stool next to them.
&quot;Weather's nice. At least for London.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nogami nodded as they pushed through the crowded doorway and
into the street. &quot;Don't say what you're thinking. Don't say you can't
imagine why I moved here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Never crossed my mind.&quot; Vance took a breath of the
fresh air, expelling the residual smoke from his lungs. The lunchtime mob
elbowed them from every side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know the reason as well as I do. It's all part of
our overall strategy. Japan is a world player now, Michael. I'm part of the
vanguard that's going to do to financial services worldwide what we did to
semiconductors and electronics. You just watch and see.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I already believe it.&quot; He did. Japan's dominance
of the world money scene was just a matter of time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They navigated their way through the midday throng. On every
side lunchtime shoppers were munching sandwiches, lining up for knick-knacks to
take back to the office. They strolled past the rear of the tubular-steel
Lloyds building, then headed down a cobblestone side street toward the river.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But we had to come here and buy our base in order to be
part of the financial game in Europe,&quot; Nogami continued, not missing a
beat. &quot;We expect to be major players before long.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd say you're already one. When the Plaza Accord
sliced the greenback in half, it doubled the value of Japan's bankroll. Every
yen you had was suddenly worth twice as many dollars, as if by magic.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We can't complain.&quot; He paused to inhale the gray,
heavy air. &quot;Of course the locals here in London are constantly enlisting
their 'old boy' regulators to make up new rules to hamper us, but Tokyo
invented that little ploy. It almost makes this place feel like home.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Word is you play all the games. I hear Westminster
Union now handles more Eurodollar deals than anybody.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We pull our weight.&quot; He smiled and dodged a red
double-decker bus as they crossed Lower Thames Street. &quot;You name a major
currency, we'll underwrite the debt offering.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Lots of action.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There is indeed. Sometimes perhaps too much. Which is
why I wanted to talk down here, by the river. Shall we stroll out onto London
Bridge?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sounds good.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Spread before them now was the muddy, gray expanse of London's
timeless waterway. Shakespeare had gazed on it. Handel had written music to
accompany fireworks shot over it. Today a few tugs were moving slowly up the
center channel, and a sightseeing boat was headed down to Greenwich. Cranes of
the new Docklands development loomed over the horizon downriver.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what's the problem?&quot; Vance turned to study his
face. There was worry there, and pain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, that 'individual' you spoke of. He has, in the
famous phrase, 'made me an offer I can't refuse.' He wants me to handle a debt
issue, corporate debentures, bigger than anything this town has ever seen.
Anything Europe has ever seen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You should be ordering champagne.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not this time.&quot; He turned back to study the river.
&quot;The whole thing stinks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who're the players?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's supposedly to raise capital for the Mino
Industries Group. I've been 'asked' to underwrite the bonds, then unload them
with minimal fanfare and keep a low profile.&quot; He looked back. &quot;But
it's almost fraud, Michael. I don't think there's anything behind them at all.
Nothing. The beneficiaries are just phony Mino Industries shadow corporations.
Only nobody will know it. You see, the bonds are zero-coupons, paying no
interest till they mature ten years from now. So it will be a full decade
before the buyers find out they've acquired paper with no backing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Won't be the first time the sheep got sheared by a
hustler.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, I'm not a hustler,&quot; he snapped. &quot;And
there's more. They're so-called bearer bonds. Which means there's no record of
who holds them. Just one more trick to keep this thing below the radar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Typical. 'Bearer bonds' always sell like hotcakes in
high-tax locales like the Benelux countries. That mythical Belgian dentist can
buy them anonymously and screw the tax man.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, that's part of what makes Eurocurrency ideal for
this, all that homeless money floating around over here. No government is
really responsible for keeping track of it. In fact, every effort has been made
to ensure that these debentures appeal to greed. Their yield will float, pegged
at two full points above the thirty-year British government bond, the gilt. As
lead underwriter I'll have the main responsibility, but I'm also supposed to
form a syndicate of Japanese brokerage houses here—Nomura, Daiwa, Sumitomo, the
others—to make sure the offering goes off without a hitch. But that precaution
will hardly be necessary. At those interest rates, they should practically fly
out the door.&quot; He sighed. &quot;Which is a good thing, because . . .
because, Michael, the amount I'm being asked to underwrite is a hundred billion
dollars.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And that's just for the first year, right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nogami looked up, startled. &quot;How did you know?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Call it a lucky guess.&quot; He took a deep breath. So
that's where the funding stipulated in the protocol was going to come from.
European suckers. My God, he thought, the play is superb.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, nobody could float an offering like that and
have it covered with real assets. Nobody. Taken all together that's enough
money to capitalize a dozen world-class corporations.&quot; He paused. &quot;Of
course, I won't be offering it all at once. The debentures will dribble out
over the period of a year, and then the next year, it starts all over again.
For five years.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So you're supposed to raise five hundred billion
dollars in the Eurobond market over five years. Not impossible, but it's a tall
order.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Especially since the ratings will be smoke and mirrors.
It is, in effect, an unsecured loan.&quot; He looked away, down at the swirling
brown surface of the Thames. &quot;You know what it really means? He wants me
to sell <i>junk bonds</i>. And I can't refuse.&quot; His voice came close to a
quaver. &quot;Just when I was well into earning the esteem of the European
banking community, I'm suddenly about to become the Drexel Burnham of
Eurobonds. I'll be operating the investment equivalent of a shell game.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, why are you telling me all this?&quot; Vance had
never seen him this upset.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Because I have to find out what this is all about. What
the money's going to be used for.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I take it the Tokyo <i>oyabun’s</i> not talking.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, no one dares question him. You know
that.&quot; His voice grew formal. &quot;It's the Yakuza way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, you're in London now. A free man.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's not that simple. You may not know—it's a very
well-kept secret—that he capitalized my takeover of the Westminster Union Bank
here. He put together a consortium of private financiers for me. A lot of the
money was actually his. The whole thing had to be low profile, since none of
our banks dared have its name associated with a hostile takeover in London. Our
institutions are still squeamish about such things. They all cheered me on in
private, but in public they didn't know anything about it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe he had this little return favor in mind all
along.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;To tell you the truth, I've since wondered that myself.
Anyway, now he's calling in my obligation. We Japanese call it <i>giri</i>. I
have to play. But either way I'm ruined. If I do it, I'll become a pariah in
the European banking community. If I don't . . . well, the consequences are
almost unthinkable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, I don't know how to say this, but there's a chance
this whole scenario is bigger than anything you can imagine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nogami turned to stare. &quot;What do you know?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let's just say I hear things. But first we need to
strike our deal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course. As I said, I'll send a telex, from my secure
trading room, for what good it may do. But you've got to help me too.
Please.&quot; He turned back to the river. &quot;You know, Michael, I like my
life here. More and more. Even given all that's going on here these days, the
pace is still much more civilized than Tokyo. For all our prosperity back home,
I think we've traded something very valuable. Call it our soul perhaps. Here I
feel almost free from the old days, part of a real, legitimate world. I hated
all the money laundering, the shady deals. These days I can look myself in the
face.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was temporarily changing professions myself, until
about a week ago. Then this problem came up.&quot; He waved to a pleasure boat
slowly motoring up the river. It was only a thirty footer, but the lines reminded
him of the <i>Ulysses</i>. It made him suddenly homesick for real sunshine and
real air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, what's going on? We need to work
together.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll just say this. I think the godfather's got a big
surprise cooking. Maybe we're both caught in the middle.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He smiled. &quot;If that's true, we can help each other out.
Though I can't push too hard.&quot; He took a deep breath and gazed at the
murky London sky. &quot;But still . . . I'll tell you the truth. I'm very
seriously thinking I may just refuse to touch the whole thing. Tanzan Mino—yes,
why not name names? He's even made vague threats against my family. The man has
pushed me too far this time. Somewhere it has to end.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're a brave man. He still runs some very persuasive
muscle. Better have your life insurance paid up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm well aware. But I don't want to jeopardize everything
I've built here. My whole new life. So that's why I need you. If you could find
out what's behind all this, I could decide whether I should risk everything and
go ahead with the offering. Or just stand up to him at last. Otherwise . .
.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's the timing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have to list the first offering with the Issuing
House Association day after tomorrow. We've already put together the paperwork,
just in case.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Pretty tight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, I'll see what I can do about your problem. And
if there's anything else, you know I'll try my best.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Depending on whether my message gets through, I could
be needing somebody to handle some cash. A reasonably substantial sum. Maybe as
part of our little quid pro quo you could arrange it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is this money . . .?&quot; He paused awkwardly.
&quot;Well, you understand my question.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's laundered. Clean as a hound's tooth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where is it now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Vance smiled. &quot;It's
liquid.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And the sum?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hang on to your bowler hat. It's around a hundred
million U.S.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is that all?&quot; he laughed. &quot;That figure is
barely a blip on the screen these days. For a minute there I thought you were
talking real money.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Seems a reasonably substantial sum.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's scarcely more than walking-around money in our
business, as you well know. Over two hundred billion passes through the foreign
exchange markets every day, a large amount of it right here in London.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, there could be a small complication, if the KGB
gets into the action.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;KGB?&quot; He pulled up sharply. &quot;What in bloody
hell do they—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's a long story.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why would Soviet intelligence be involved? They're
supposed to be keeping a lower profile these days.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Rumor has it they let this one get past them. The money
left home without a passport and now they look like fools for letting it
happen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I see.&quot; He grew silent, then glanced at his watch
and pulled his overcoat tighter. &quot;Well, perhaps I should send that cable
now. Before Tokyo tucks in for the night.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The sooner the better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And the matter of concern to me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me think it over.&quot; Vance spoke slowly.
&quot;But in the meantime, I'd strongly advise you to hold off with the
offering.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're not telling me what you know. Is that
fair?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No. But who said the world's got to be fair? There's a
play about to go down. I know about part of it, not all. But before I'm
through, well, let's just say that when somebody starts using muscle on me, I
sort of lose my sense of proportion.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is it that bad?&quot; His stare carried alarm.
&quot;What am I supposed to do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sit tight on the offering. Don't say yes or no, just
find a way to postpone it. And send that telex. I'll dictate it for you. After
that, you can reach me at my hotel. Strand Palace.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Strand Palace? Michael, you?&quot; He smiled.
&quot;Hardly up to your usual standards.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't do as much freelance these days as I used to.
So I have to learn to live closer to my means.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll believe that when I see it,&quot; he said with a
laugh. &quot;You're not telling me the truth. About anything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're right. And it's for your own good. You just
stall on the offering and let me play this my way. If things aren't
straightened out in a day, two tops, we're both in a lot of trouble.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Two days?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It has to happen by then. Too much is going on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now you're really starting to make me alarmed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You should be.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Because if this isn't settled in two days, he thought,
somebody's probably going to be dead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       She
checked her watch, then took a last look around the spacious room. It was time.
Her bag lay on the bed, packed and waiting to be sent later. The part of her
luggage that mattered was the vinyl flight bag by the door, containing the
Zenith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With a sigh she rose, threw on her light tan raincoat, and
grabbed the bag. This was the part she'd been dreading, and she'd done her best
to try and look inconspicuous—a dressy beige outfit and a few silver
accessories. She'd also washed her hair, which always made her feel better.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The carpeted hallway was clear as she closed the door, tugged
to be certain it was secure, then took a deep breath, turned, and headed toward
the elevator. She hadn't been outside the room for almost twenty-four hours.
This, she told herself, must be what house arrest feels like.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was about to be over. All she had to do now was make her
way through the Savoy lobby, walk diagonally across the Strand, then through
another lobby, another elevator, and she'd be with Michael.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The more she allowed herself to think about the whole
situation, the angrier she got, at all the bean-counters at NSA who wouldn't
listen to her, at the entire American intelligence establishment. How could
everybody have missed what was happening?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe, she thought, the air outside would help cool her off.
She definitely needed to get out of the Savoy, if only to counter the
claustrophobia. Stretch your legs, sweetheart, and think.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The elevator chimed and the doors slid open. The crisp,
shiny, expensive fashions greeted her, the iridescence of diamonds; the night
people of London were headed out for dinner and the clubs. A cross section of
the jet set and the bored rich. Nobody seemed to be having fun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked at them as she stepped in, wondering what they
would think if they knew what was in her vinyl bag. Michael used to say the
only thing people like these were interested in was impressing headwaiters. He
was probably dead right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The LOBBY light flashed above the doors, and they slid open
to reveal muted wood paneling, English antiques, and sparkling mirrors.
Gray-suited bellboys carrying baggage and opening elevator doors mingled with
the bustling evening throng. It was a world unto itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Not pausing, she strode past the pink marble columns and
glowing chandeliers, then headed for the glassed entrance. Outside, the traffic
on the Strand, the glitter of London at night, all of it beckoned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Being in Crete again had really made her think, about a lot
of things. Mostly though, she'd thought about Michael Vance, Jr.
Ex-archaeologist, ex-spook, ex- . . . God knew what. Still, she'd seen plenty
worse . . . the paunchy assistant-this and vice-that, all divorced and paying
alimony and whining. But in this man-short time, with hungry divorcees flocking
the bars, they didn't have to bother keeping up appearances. Middle-aged decay
was their inalienable right. Mike, whatever else you said about him, still
looked as good as he had a decade ago. He was showing some mileage, sure, but
on him it didn't look half bad. Maybe it was the tequila.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Could they start over again, that new beginning he'd hinted
about? Maybe it was at least worth a try.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She moved on through the milling mob in the lobby, trying to
be casual, to blend. He'd said she should get out of the Savoy as soon as
possible, just send her things and move in with him. But why didn't he come
over and stay with her? she'd asked. The Savoy was more romantic, more like the
old days. That's when he'd abruptly switched the subject, saying they couldn't
discuss it on the phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Probably he had something working. Well, she had a few
surprises too. She'd spent the day hacking away at the protocol, and she'd
learned a lot more. It was even worse than she'd imagined.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she pushed through the revolving doors and into the
driveway, the clack-clack of London taxi motors and the rush of cold air
brought back all the adrenaline of that moment in Iraklion when she had first
seen Alex.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She grasped the flight bag more firmly and moved on down the
left-hand sidewalk, past the National Westminster Bank at the corner and toward
the street. Almost there. Just across waited the Strand Palace and safety.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In her rush, she'd missed an important event. Mingled in
among the lobby crowd was a couple she'd failed to notice. They'd been over on
her left, by the desk. The man, in a rumpled brown jacket, was haggard, with
bloodshot eyes. His beard was untrimmed, but it did disguise the bruises on his
face. Unseen by Eva he'd suddenly raised his hand and pointed at her. Nor did
she see the woman with him— dark coiffure, elegant makeup, Oscar de la Renta
cocktail dress—though she wouldn't have recognized her in any case.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Only moments after Eva Borodin walked up the Savoy driveway,
the woman was speaking into the radio she'd had in her shiny evening purse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=bookmark39><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He glanced at his watch, then looked out his smudgy hotel
window and down at the Strand. Two more minutes and there should be a knock on
the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Would she believe him? That he'd set up the play? Maybe he
couldn't quite believe it himself, but still, they had the biggest share of
poker chips now. They were about to take control of the game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was almost, almost time to relax.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he saw her, moving briskly across the Strand while
furtively looking left and right. Good. After he watched her disappear into the
lobby down below, he turned back from the window and walked to the bar. Time to
crack open the Sauza Tres Generaciones, Tequila Anejo—Mexico's well-aged
contribution to the well-being of all humankind. Hard enough to come by
anywhere, it was virtually unobtainable here in London, but his search had succeeded.
He lifted it out of its tan box, admiring the coal black bottle, then gave the
cork a twist and sniffed the fragrance, fresh as nectar, before settling it
back on the bar. Next he removed a bottle of rare Stolichnaya Starka vodka from
the freezer and stationed it beside the Sauza. This, he knew, was Eva's
favorite, made with water from the Niva River and flavored with pear leaves and
Crimean apples as well as a touch of brandy and a dash of port.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A few moments later he heard a light knock on the door, and
with a feeling of relief he stepped over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael,&quot; the voice was a muted whisper,
&quot;hurry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He swung it inward and there she was. Without a word she
moved into his arms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you okay?&quot; He touched her face, then lifted
her lips to his. They were cold, tight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes. I . . . I think so. God, what a day. I kept
wanting to call you, darling.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I assumed that. I can't wait to show you my translation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, slow down.&quot; He kissed her again. &quot;Let's
have a celebration drink first. Just you and me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, don't talk nonsense. We've got to think.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I got a bottle of your native wine, a little Tequila
Anejo for me. Never hurt the mental processes. Come on, what do you say?&quot;
He turned and headed for the bar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told them if they'll call off the gorillas, I'll see
about lightening up their money problems. The Alex Novosty imbroglio.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

just too big. I almost wonder if a newspaper would touch it, at least until we
have more than we have now.&quot; She'd set down her drink and was opening the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

thought. But here, look. This section picks up from where you left off. Mother

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked up, his eyes narrowing. &quot;So it's just what we
thought. A global horsetrade. Tokyo supplies Moscow with half a trillion in
loans and financing over the next five years, the money they need for
'restructuring,' and the Soviets cede back the territory they took after the
war, the Kurile Islands and Sakhalin, that perennial thorn in the side of the
Japanese right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not to mention which, Japan also gets a whole new
target for all that excess capital burning a hole in its pocket. As well as
first crack at Sakhalin's oil reserves. Michael, put it together and you
realize Japan's about to wrap up what she's been angling for ever since the
war—total economic dominance of the Far East, Russia and all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Right, he thought, but which Russians are making this secret
deal? Could it be the hardliners, who're lining up a new military alliance? Is
that what the &quot;prototype&quot; is all about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By the way, did you look closely at the early part, the
bit I translated?&quot; He walked over and checked the traffic on the Strand
below. &quot;There's some kind of surprise package under the tree. I don't
think it's Christmas chocolates.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean the prototype? Bothers me too.&quot; She took
another sip of her freezing Stoly. &quot;What do you think it is?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My wild guess would be some kind of advanced weapons
system. If the Soviets are planning to give back territory, they'd better be getting
some goodies.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, any way you look at it, this whole thing is
brilliant, synergistic. Everybody comes out with something they want.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;World geopolitics is about to become a whole new ball
game. But that other bit, the prototype, seems to be a really important part of
it. There're specifications, a hard delivery date, the works. That's where the
quid pro quo starts getting kinky.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It does sound like some entirely new kind of
weapon,&quot; she agreed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who knows? Whatever it turns out to be, though, it's
something they had to develop together. Which probably means high-tech. But
we're going to find out, you and me.&quot; He studied the street below, where
traffic was a blaze of headlights, then turned back. &quot;Tell me again about
those satellite photos you mentioned out at the palace.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean the ones of Hokkaido, the Japanese island up
north?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right. What exactly was in them? You said it looked
like a runway?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I said that's what I thought it was. But nobody at NSA
is authorized to be interested officially in what goes on in Japan, so the
oversight committee wouldn't spring for a real analysis, an infrared overlay or
anything. The budget cuts, et cetera.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Which is exactly what whoever planned this figured on,
right? If you had some military surprise cooking, what bette</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r place</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> to hide it than in the wilds of
northern Japan, where nobody would bother to pay attention?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, the location couldn't be more perfect for a joint
project. Hokkaido is right across the straits from Sakhalin. All nice and
convenient.&quot; She stared at her vodka as the room fell silent. &quot;Maybe
if we finished the translation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Somehow I doubt it's going to spell out the details.
The </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>so-called
prototype hasn't been described so far, at least as far as we've got. Probably
a deliberate omission.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Our problem is, without the full text nobody's going to
take our word for all this.&quot; She finished off her Stoly with a gulp, then
got up to pour another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe there's a way.&quot; He caught her and pulled her
into his arms. &quot;But first things first. Why don't we forget about
everything just for tonight?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stared at him incredulously. &quot;Darling, get serious.
Right now there are people out there wanting to make us disappear because we
know too much. They've already tried. That's very real.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, that's being handled. Why can't you trust
me?&quot; He hugged her again. &quot;I think it's time we had an evening just
for us. So how about a small intimate reunion tonight, right here, dinner for
two? While we wait for the fish to bite.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't believe I'm hearing this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We'll both slip into something comfortable, have the
greatest meal in the world sent up, along with about a case of wine, then
retire to that plush bed over there and spend the rest of the evening getting
reacquainted?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're serious, aren't you?&quot; She studied his eyes.
They had a lascivious twinkle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She hesitated, then thought, Why not call his bluff?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right. If you can be insane, then I can too. But if
we're going to do it, then let's go all the way. I'm sick of living off room service.&quot;
She slapped down her glass. &quot;Know what I really want? I want to go out
somewhere expensive and splashy. With you. I want to do London.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Great!&quot; He was beaming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whoops. He hadn't been bluffing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I dare you.&quot; She rose and threw her arms around
him. Suddenly it was all too wonderful to forgo. &quot;We'll put this Zenith in
the hotel safe and act like real people for an evening. Then we'll come back
here and you'll get totally ravished. That's a promise, sweetheart.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I sort of had it figured for the other way
around.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, yeah. We'll see, and may the best ravisher
win.&quot; She clicked off the computer and shoved it into the flight bag, then
turned back. &quot;How about that wonderful restaurant we went to way back
when? You know. That night we both got so drunk and you almost offered to make
an honest woman of me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;An offer you saw fit to refuse in advance.&quot; He
looked her over. &quot;But I assume you mean that place up in Islington? What
was it? The Wellington or something?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right. It was sort of out of the way. Down a little
alley.&quot; She threw her arms around him. &quot;That night was so wonderfully
romantic, like a honeymoon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It almost was,&quot; he smiled, remembering.
&quot;Let's call for a reservation and just go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Darling, are we acting insane?&quot; She looked up,
eyes uncertain. &quot;I'm half afraid.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't be.&quot; He touseled her hair before thinking.
&quot;Nobody's going to touch you, believe me. I've nailed the bastards. All of
them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was flawless. They dined in a Gothic, ivy-covered
greenhouse in the garden of a maitre nineteenth-century inn where waiters
scurried, the maitre d' hovered, and the wine steward nodded obsequiously every
time he passed their table. It was even better than their first visit. After a
roulade of red caviar, Eva had the ragout au gratin, Vance the boeuf a la
ficelle, his favorite. For dessert they shared the house specialty, tulipe
glacee aux fruits, after which they lingered over Stilton cheese and a World
War I bottle of Lisbon port.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>And they talked and laughed and talked. They both tried
to focus on the good times: trips they'd taken, places they'd shared, what
they'd do next—together. She even agreed to spend August helping him sail the
Ulysses over to Crete, his latest plan. The gap in time began slowly to drop
away. It was as though they'd been reborn; everything felt new, fresh, and full
of delight. Who said you couldn't start over?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Neither wanted it to end, but finally, reluctantly, he
signaled for the check. After a round of farewells from the staff, they
staggered out into the brisk evening air.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where to now?&quot; He was helping her into a black London
taxicab, after drunkenly handing the uniformed doorman a fiver.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;God, I'm so giddy I can't think.&quot; She crashed into
the seat and leaned her head against his shoulder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yanks?&quot; The driver glanced back with a genuine
smile. He wore a dark cap and sported a handlebar mustache of Dickensian
proportions. &quot;Been to New York myself, you know, with the missus. Two
years back. Don't know how you lot can stand the bleedin' crime, though.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Worse every year,&quot; Vance nodded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So, where'll it be, my lords and ladies?&quot; He hit
the ignition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How about heading down to the Thames, say Victoria
Embankment Gardens, around in there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Lovely spot for a stroll. Private like, if you know
what I mean.&quot; He winked, then revved the engine and started working the
vehicle down the narrow street, headed toward the avenue. &quot;Thing about the
States, you'd be daft to walk in a park there after dark.&quot; He glanced
back. &quot;So how was it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Wellington, mate. You know, I take plenty of Arabs
there, bleedin' wogs, them and their fine Soho tarts.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We made do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you've got the quid, why not. That's what I always
say.&quot; He smiled above his mustache. &quot;Guess you know IRA bombed the
front room about ten years back, bloody bastards. Lobbed one right through the
big window.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We were hoping they'd never hit the same place
twice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;With those bloodthirsty micks you never know, mate, you
never know. Only good thing about the States, no bleedin' IRA.&quot; He made a
right turn off Goswell Road onto Clerkenwell Road. Even at this late hour, the
traffic was brisk, black taxis side by side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, I love Victoria Gardens.&quot; Eva reached up
and bit his ear. &quot;Can we dance in the moonlight?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why not. I think it's romantic as hell.&quot; He drew
her closer. &quot;Probably shouldn't tell you this, but back in my youth, when
I was living in London one summer, I used to take a plump little Irish hotel
maid down there. I confess to a series of failed assaults on her well-guarded
Catholic virtue.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe this time your luck will change,&quot; she
giggled. And she bit him again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll never be seventeen again, but I'm willing to give
it one more try.&quot; He turned to study the traffic behind them. Had the play
started already?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yep, there it was. A dark car was following them, had pulled
out right behind as they left the restaurant's side street. It was trailing
discreetly, but it was in place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Pretty much on schedule, he told himself. They must have
found out by now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Darling, I want to make you feel seventeen all over
again.&quot; She snuggled closer. &quot;I'm starting to feel good again. I'd
almost forgot you could do that for me. Thank you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He kissed her, then leaned forward and spoke through the
partition. &quot;See those headlights behind us?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think they were waiting outside, at the restaurant.
Noticed them there. Now they look to be going wherever you're going.&quot; The
burly cabbie glanced into his side mirror. &quot;Friends of yours?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In a manner of speaking. I think we've just revised our
destination. Make it the Savoy instead. The main entrance there on the
Strand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Whatever you say. Forget the park?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You've got it. And try not to lose them. Just make sure
they don't know that you know. Figure it out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Having some sport with your friends, eh?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Work on it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, Christ.&quot; Eva revolved to look. &quot;Michael,
what is it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My guess is somebody found out something, and they're
very upset.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She grasped his hand. &quot;Why not try and lose them in the
traffic?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They probably know where we're staying. What's the
point?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I do hope you know what you're doing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Trust me. The Savoy's a nice friendly place for a
drink. We'll ask them in, maybe drop by the American bar, there on the
mezzanine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why did we go out?&quot; She threw her arms around him.
&quot;I knew it was a risk and still—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Relax.&quot; He kissed her. &quot;We're just headed
home after a lovely dinner. And when we get there, maybe we'll ask them in for
a nightcap.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who do you think it is?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is a friendly town. Why don't we just wait and
find out?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right. I'm dying to know who wants to kill us
now.&quot; She turned to stare again at the headlights. &quot;After all, it's
been almost a day and a half since somebody's—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, we've had a great evening. Nobody's going to spoil
that. This will just top it off.&quot; He looked back again, then leaned forward
as the driver turned onto the Strand. &quot;Be sure and take us all the way
down the driveway.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Whatever you say.&quot; He flipped on his blinker, then
checked the mirror. &quot;Seems your friends are coming along.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the idea.&quot; Vance passed him a ten-pound note
as they rolled to a halt. &quot;Nice job, by the way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Anything for a Yank.&quot; He checked the bill, then
tipped his hat. &quot;Many thanks, gov'nor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael.&quot; Eva froze. &quot;I'm not getting
out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on.&quot; He reached for her hand. &quot;This is
going to be the most fun we've had all night.&quot; He looked up at the
gray-uniformed Savoy doorman approaching. &quot;Trust me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The other car, a black Mercedes, had stopped just behind
them, and now its doors swung out on both sides. The first to emerge were two
surly men in heavy, bulging suits; next came an expensively dressed,
dark-haired woman; and the last was a bearded man who had to be helped. He
seemed weak and shaky.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance waved to him and beckoned him forward. &quot;Alex, what
a surprise. Glad you brought your friends. I was starting to worry we might
miss each other this time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael.&quot; His voice faltered as he walked past the
others, limping. &quot;We must talk. Now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Great idea. Let's ask everybody in for a drink.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The woman was staring, cold as ice, while the two men flanked
her on either side, waiting. Vance smiled and greeted her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Vera, talk about luck. And I'll bet you were worried we
wouldn't manage to meet up in London. Small world.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The woman was trying to ignore him as she addressed Eva.
&quot;You have in your possession classified Soviet materials.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If I do, that's your problem.&quot; She glared back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, Ms. Borodin.&quot; The woman moved forward, carrying
a leather purse. &quot;It is your problem.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, now. Looks like we're all ready for a
nightcap.&quot; Vance took Eva's hand, nodded at the doorman, and led her
through the lobby doors. Over his shoulder he yelled back. &quot;I honestly
recommend the American bar upstairs. Terrific view.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, please wait.&quot; Novosty limped after him,
through the doorway, then grasped his arm. &quot;We need to talk first.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;About what?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;You know very well. The money. Michael, the
game is up, can't you see? I've got to return it, all of it, and face the
consequences, God help me. I have no choice. They—&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, Alex, that's probably a good idea. Things
were getting too rough. This was a hustle you should have left to the big boys.
I tried to tell you that back in Athens, the other morning. Just give it
back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you saying?&quot; He went pale.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just return the money. Try and make them see it was a
misunderstanding. How were you supposed to know it was embezzled? You were just
following orders, right? They can probably cover the whole thing over as just
some kind of paperwork shuffle.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, don't play games with me.&quot; He was
clenching Vance's sleeve, his voice pleading.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, we're partners, remember? I'll back you all the
way.&quot; He urged Eva on past the gaggle of bellmen and into the marbled
lobby. The chandeliers sparkled and the room still bustled with bejeweled
evening people. &quot;Now we're all just going to have a very civilized
drink.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The possibility of that seemed to be diminishing, however.
The two men, clearly KGB &quot;chauffeurs,&quot; had now moved alongside
menacingly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You will come with us.&quot; Vera Karanova was approaching
Eva. &quot;Both of you. A car is waiting, at the entrance on the river
side.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Down by the park?&quot; Vance kept urging Eva across
the lobby, toward the staircase leading up to the bar. &quot;Funny thing. We
were just talking about the Embankment Gardens.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vera nodded toward the empty tearoom and the steps beyond,
which led down toward the river side, then spoke quietly in Russian to the two
men. They shouldered against Vance, the one on the right reaching for Eva's
arm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Easy with the muscle, hero.&quot; He caught the man's
paisley tie and yanked him around, spinning him off balance, then kneed him
onto the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, wait.&quot; Novosty stepped between them, then
took Vance's arm and drew him farther ahead. &quot;About the money.
You've—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What about it?&quot; He looked puzzled. &quot;Just
return it, like I told you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Novosty's eyes twitched above his beard. &quot;Michael, the
entire sum was withdrawn from the Moscow Narodny Bank at eleven o'clock this
morning. The whole hundred million. It's vanished.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sounds like a problem. Now how do you suppose a thing
like that could have happened?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know very well.&quot; His voice was almost a sob.
&quot;It was authorized right after the bank opened. Someone requested that the
funds be converted into Eurodollar bearer bonds and open cashiers checks, all
small denominations. Which were then picked up by a bonded courier
service.&quot; His voice cracked again. &quot;I don't know what to do. The bank
claims they have no more responsibility.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Legally, I guess that's right. They're probably in the
clear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, you must have arranged it. Using the account
numbers and identification I gave you—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Prove it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But how? I have to return the funds, or they'll kill
me. I told them only you could have done it, but they don't believe me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Interesting thing about bearer bonds and open cashiers
checks. They're same as cash. Everybody's favorite form of hot money. Very
liquid and totally untraceable. For all we know your hundred million could be
in Geneva by now, taking in the view of the lake.&quot; He turned and pecked
Eva on the cheek. &quot;Ready for that nightcap?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Novosty caught his arm and tried to pull him back. &quot;You
won't get away with this. I'm warning you. You're a dead man.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, I sort of look at it the other way around. I
figure whoever copped that cash this morning got a hundred-million-dollar
insurance policy. Because you see, if T-Directorate wants to kiss their hundred
million <i>do svedania</i>, the best way possible would be to keep up with the
muscle here tonight. That could make it just disappear forever. There'd be a
lot of explaining to do. Probably make a very negative impression on certain
people back at Dzerzhinsky Square. Vera here might even have to turn in all her
gold cards.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you saying?&quot; Now Comrade Karanova had
moved closer. &quot;Is it really true you have the embezzled funds?&quot; She
examined Vance with a startled look, then glanced at Novosty, as though to
confirm. His eyes were defeated as he nodded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You should check the desk here more often.&quot; Vance
pointed toward the mahogany reception. &quot;Photocopies of the open cashiers
checks were dropped off for you at nine o'clock tonight. So maybe it's time
everybody talked to me.&quot; He thumbed back at her two bodyguards. &quot;For
starters how about losing those two apes. Send them down to the park for a
stroll. Then maybe we can talk. Over a drink. The vanguard of the proletariat
sits down with the decadent capitalists. Could be there's a deal here yet. East
meets West.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell me what you want,&quot; Vera Karanova said,
without noticeable enthusiasm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;For starters, how about some protection. If these
incompetents of yours can manage it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;From whom?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, there's a deal cooking, and I think there's more
to it than meets the eye. I do know there's a very smart individual, on the
other side of the globe, who's got some very definite plans for Eva and me. As
well as for Mother Russia. I would suggest it might be in your interest to help
us stop him while we still can. He's never played straight, and I don't think
he's about to start now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have my responsibilities too. Just return the money
and we will handle the situation after that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The best thing you can do right now is stay out of the
way. I've seen too many screw-ups out of Dzerzhinsky Square to turn this thing
over to Moscow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Vance, you are playing a dangerous game.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you want to see the money again, it's the only game
going. Now do we play or what?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When did you receive this?&quot; Tanzan Mino glanced
over the cable message once again, then looked up. Although the time was near
midnight, the aide had found him still behind his black slate desk. The lights
in his penthouse office were turned low, muting the already dull earth tones of
the walls. Neko paced across the expanse fronting the wide picture window,
flicking her tail and anticipating her evening dinner of water buffalo <i>tartare</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Fifteen minutes ago, Mino-sama.&quot; He eyed
the leopard nervously. &quot;It was logged in on the eleventh floor, over the
secure telex. I was reluctant to bother you at this late hour.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When you live to my age, you no longer have the patience
for sleep. There is so much to do and so little time. Two or three hours are
all I allow myself now.&quot; He tossed the paper onto his desk, then rose,
strolled to the darkened window and, gently pushing Neko aside, gazed down. Below,
the neon-lighted streets of Tokyo's Ueno district blazed. &quot;In a way this
news is welcome. Perhaps the money is no longer in the hands of an incompetent.
I have always preferred doing business with a professional.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You would consider dealing with him?&quot; The subordinate,
in dark suit and crisp white shirt, tried to mask the surprise in his voice.
The <i>oyabun</i> had never let himself be blackmailed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;You seem startled.&quot; He smiled, then
walked over and extracted a raw steak from the cooler in the corner. Neko
dropped to her haunches as he tossed it to her. &quot;Don't be. I've spent a
lifetime in negotiation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That much, his subordinate knew, was true. Tanzan Mino had
seen more deals than most men would in a hundred lifetimes. The most important
ones had been the back-room kind. For thirty-five years, he'd funneled vast
chunks of laundered cash to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's leading
politicians, and as a result, he enjoyed final say over all its major
decisions, dictating the choice of cabinet ministers, even prime ministers. He
was the undisputed godfather of Japan's <i>kuroi kiri</i>, &quot;black
mist,&quot; the unseen world of political deal making.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The subordinate also admired Tanzan Mino's discretion. After
his ascension to kingpin of the LDP, U.S. interests had funneled over $12
million in cash bribes through him to Japan's most powerful political figures,
much of it handled by the Lockheed Corporation. In return, that corporation
received over $1 billion in sales to Japan's government and civilian airlines,
while the CIA got to sleep easy, knowing America's interests were receiving the
close attention of Japan's decision makers. But then, when newspapers finally
broke the story that Lockheed's American money had reached the highest levels
of the LDP, Tanzan Mino arranged for a rival <i>kuromaku</i>, Yoshio Kodama, to
take the fall. As befitted a true professional, he escaped without a hint of
scandal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was a deft move that brought him much prestige among those
in the circles of power. Besides, with a Yakuza income in the billions, he
certainly needed none of the Lockheed money himself. His perennial concern, as
everyone also knew, was what to do with all his cash. By the late fifties, Mino
Industries Group already owned real estate, shipping lines, construction companies,
trucking concerns, newspapers, baseball teams, film companies, even banks.
Eventually, when Japan couldn't absorb any more investment, he'd expanded
abroad, opening luxurious offices in other Southeast Asian cities, including
new digs in Manila's Makati, the Wall Street of Asia, in Hong Kong, in
Singapore (a favorite Yakuza town for recruiting prostitutes), in</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Taipei, and
on and on. But still, there was the money. And more money . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kenji Nogami's predecessor had finally suggested the perfect
solution to Tanzan Mino's cash dilemma. The safest, most welcome haven for Mino
Industries' excess money was just across the Pacific, on the island of Hawaii,
where his investments could be protected by the American fleet at Pearl Harbor.
In the early sixties he opened a branch of his shadow investment company,
Shoshu Kagai, in Honolulu, and today he was, through dummy corporations, the
largest landowner in the state.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

and prominent rightists in the Japanese business community, Tanzan Mino turned
abroad in the early seventies, offering deals and support to Pacific Rim
strongmen such as Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, Ferdinand Marcos.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All of it, however, had merely been preparation for this, his
final objective. He was about to reclaim Japanese territory lost in the war,
open Soviet Asia for Japan, and pillage the world's leading space program—all
in one synergistic strike. Best of all, he was going to do it using foreign, <i>gaijin
</i>money.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Any Yakuza understood well the truth of that classic
banking precept: If a man owes you a hundred dollars, you have power over him;
if he owes you a million dollars, he has power over you. Tanzan Mino, his
subordinate knew, had no intention of handing over half a trillion dollars of
Yakuza capital to the Soviet Union, Japan's long-time military adversary. Only
a fool would risk that kind of financial exposure, and Tanzan Mino was no fool.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which was why he had arranged to tap into the most
free-wheeling capital pool of them all: Eurodollars. The money would be raised
in London from thousands of anonymous investors through a standard
bait-and-switch, then passed through Tokyo banks. No one, least of all the
stupid Soviets, would have the slightest idea what was going on. The scenario
was brilliant: Japanese financial, industrial, and technological muscle used in
concert to realize the ultimate strategic global coup. His lieutenants were
unanimous in their admiration.</span></p>

&quot;<i>Hai</i>, Mino-sama. Michael Vance. We ran his name through the

the CIA. The open file ended almost exactly eight years ago, however, and all
information subsequent to that—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

Felix Vasilevich Budnikov, robust director of flight control systems; and
Andrei Petrovich Androv, director of propulsion systems. On Lemontov's right

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Seated across the metal table, facing them all, was Yuri
Andreevich Androv.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We will begin today's agenda by reviewing Monday
morning's test flight,&quot; Ikeda began, speaking in Russian. He was chairing
the meeting as though by mutual consent. Soviet booster technology and
aerodynamic know-how might be what made the project go, but when all was said
and done, it was the money that talked. And the project financing was Japanese.
&quot;The pilot's report will be our first item.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yuri nodded and glanced at the notes on the table before him.
Make this quick, he told himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm happy to report that, once again, the handling
characteristics of the vehicle correlated closely with our up-and-away
simulation in the Fujitsu SX-10. On takeoff the vehicle rotated very nicely
into a lift-off attitude of six point five degrees. My target attitude was seven
point five degrees, and once I'd captured that I accelerated out to seven
hundred knots, then climbed to forty-nine thousand feet for the first series of
maneuver blocks—the roll maneuvers, pitch maneuvers, and yaw maneuvers—intended
to verify handling characteristics and control activity at high altitude. As on
all other flights, the directional stability was excellent, with a very large
restoring moment. In the yaw maneuvers, one rudder kick gave me an overshoot
but the vehicle immediately steadied. And the pitch maneuvers again showed that
her actuating system enhances stability very fast. In fact, all maneuvers
matched our simulations within acceptable limits. I also did some banks up to
fifty degrees to get the stick force as I pulled back. The turn performance
matched specifications, with very little control activity required. I also
carried out some bank-to- bank maneuvers, to get the roll rates; the block
included quarter stick, half stick, and three-quarter stick. Very stable. The
augmented controls did not move out, that is, move around a lot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He paused for breath, stealing a glance at the room. Just
bury them in data overload, he thought. Don't give them time to ask questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before anyone could speak, he pressed on. &quot;I also took
the vehicle through the prescribed block of throttle maneuvers. Remember that
in ramjet mode the engines are fan-controlled, with all controls in the initial
stage. As scheduled, I pulled all the throttles to idle and then took them all
the way up to rated thrust. And as always, they were very responsive and didn't
have to hunt for their setting.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good,&quot; Ikeda said, &quot;but the main
reason—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Exactly. As scheduled, at 0210 hours I terminated JP-7
feed to the portside outboard trident, causing an unstart. With asymmetric
thrust, I expected adverse yaw, as in the roll maneuver, but the control system
stabilized it immediately. I also assumed there'd be some sideslip, so I put
rudder in, but then I realized handling was going to be feet on the floor. This
vehicle is a dream.&quot; He paused to smile. &quot;Anyway, I then initiated
restart at 0219 hours.&quot; He shoved forward the documents piled by his side.
&quot;These charts indicate that rpm achieved ninety percent nominal within
eleven seconds. All the—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've already reviewed those,&quot; Ikeda interrupted,
not looking down. &quot;We are pleased with the results of your maneuver
blocks, Major Androv, and also the vehicle's turboramjet restart
characteristics.&quot; He cleared his throat. &quot;However, there was another
maneuver last night that does not please us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Here it comes, Yuri thought. The fucker wants to know what
happened. Get your story ready.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you are undoubtedly aware,&quot; Ikeda continued,
&quot;the Japanese space program has an advanced spacecraft tracking center at
Tsukuba Science City, with two Facom M-380-R primary computers. The center is
linked to a tracking antenna at Katsura, near Tokyo, as well as to one at the
Masuda station, near our spacecraft launch pads on Tanegeshima.&quot; He glared
at the younger Androv. &quot;You are cognizant of that, are you not?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I am.&quot; He met Ikeda's gaze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We engage those tracking stations for your test flights
because of the altitudes involved. When <i>Daedalus </i>is airborne, all their
other assignments are temporarily shunted to our deep-space tracking facility
on Okinawa, in the south.&quot; He paused again, as though to control his
anger. &quot;In other words, we have arranged it so that the stations at
Katsura and Masuda are dedicated to your flights whenever you take her aloft.
You are aware of that as well?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course.&quot; Yuri started to smile, but stopped
himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then we are puzzled, Major Androv. How do you explain
the following events? At 0230 hours you shut down your air-traffic-control
transponder. That was proper, since you were scheduled to switch to classified
frequencies. But you did not report immediately on those frequencies, as
specified in the mission flight plan. For approximately twelve minutes we had
no navigational information from you whatsoever. Also, radio and computer
linkages were interrupted.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;An inadvertent mistake,&quot; Yuri said, shifting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We thought so at first. In fact, both our tracking
stations automatically performed a computerized frequency scan, thinking you'd
switched to the wrong channels by accident, but you had not. You deliberately
terminated all communications. We want to know why.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was pretty busy in the cockpit just then. I
guess—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, we assumed you would be, since you insisted on
shutting down the navigational computers,&quot; Ikeda continued, his voice like
the icy wind whistling across the island. &quot;We find your next action
particularly troubling. At that time we still had you on tracking radar, and we
observed that as soon as the transponder was turned off, you altered your
heading one hundred forty degrees . . . south, over the Japan Sea. Then you
performed some unscheduled maneuver, perhaps a snap-roll, and immediately began
a rapid descent. At that moment we lost you on the radar. With no radio
contact, we feared it was a flame-out, that you'd crashed the vehicle. But
then, at exactly 0242 hours you reappeared on the Katsura radar, ascending at
thirty- eight thousand feet. At that time radio contact also was resumed.&quot;
Ikeda paused, trying to maintain his composure. &quot;What explanation do you
have for this occurrence, and for what appeared to be an explicit radar-evasion
maneuver?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know anything about the radar. I just wanted to
check out handling characteristics under different conditions. It was only a
minor add-on to the scheduled maneuvers, which is why I didn't—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Which is why you didn't include it in your flight report.&quot;
Ikeda's dark eyes bored into him. &quot;Is that what you expect us to
assume?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Soviet team was exchanging nervous glances. They all knew
Yuri Androv was sometimes what the Americans called a cowboy, but this
unauthorized hot-dogging sounded very irresponsible. None of them had heard
about it until now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Major Androv,&quot; Ikeda interrupted him, &quot;you
are on official leave from the Soviet Air Force. No one in this room has the
military rank to discipline you. But I would like you to know that we view this
infraction as a very grave circumstance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're right. It was stupid.&quot; Time to knuckle
under, he thought. &quot;Let me formally apologize to the project management,
here and now. It was a grave lapse of judgment on my part.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yuri Andreevich, I must say I'm astonished,&quot; the
elder Androv finally spoke up. &quot;I had no idea you would ever take it into
your head to do something like this, to violate a formal test sequence.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He smiled weakly. &quot;I just . . . well, I always like to
try and expand the envelope a little, see what a new bird's got in her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And, he told himself, I did. Just now. I found out two
things. First, I can evade the bastards' tracking stations by switching off the
transponder, then going &quot;on the deck.&quot; I can defeat their network and
disappear. I needed to find out if it could be done and now I have. Great!
Ikeda's other little slip merely confirms what I'd begun to suspect. This
fucking plane is designed to—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Major Androv, this unacceptable behavior must not be
repeated.&quot; Ikeda's eyes were filled with anger and his tone carried an
unmistakable edge of threat. &quot;Do you understand? Never. This project has
far too much at stake to jeopardize it by going outside stipulated
procedure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I understand.&quot; Yuri bowed his head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you?&quot; The project director's voice rose,
uncharacteristically. &quot;If any such reckless action is ever repeated, I
warn you now that there will be consequences. Very grave consequences.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Bet your ass there'll be consequences, Yuri thought. Because
the next time I do it, I'm going to smoke out Mino Industries' whole game plan.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yuri, what—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It had passed through almost as though the beam were made of
Styrofoam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's not metal. It's a layered carbon-carbon composite.
Just like the flaps. A damned expensive material, even for them. For the
leading edges, maybe even all the exterior, it makes sense, because of the skin
temperature in the hypersonic regime. But why in here? Inside? Why use it for
these interior structural components?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps it was to economize on weight, I don't
know.&quot; The old man wrinkled his already-wrinkled brow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Wrong again. Now look up there.&quot; He directed his
father's gaze to the ceiling of the bay. &quot;Notice how the lining</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>is
sawtooth-shaped. I've seen this kind of design before. Weight's not the
reason.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what are you saying?&quot; The old man's confusion
was genuine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're out of touch with the real world.&quot; He
smiled grimly. &quot;Maybe you've been buried at Baikonur too long, with your
head in string quartets and classical Greek. This carbon-carbon composite is
used for all the structural elements. There's virtually no metal in this plane
at all. And the shape of the fuselage, all those sweeping curves and
streamlining. It's probably smart aerodynamic design, sure, but it serves
another purpose too. This vehicle has been well thought out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't you get it? <i>Radar.</i> The shape of the
fuselage is deliberately designed to diffuse and deflect radar. And all that
honeycombing on the underside is radar-absorbing. Then this in here. The
carbon-carbon composites used for this airframe, and that saw-toothing up
there, will just absorb what radar energy does get through.&quot; He turned
back. &quot;This vehicle is as radar-defeating as the U.S. Stealth bomber.
Maybe more so. Some of our experimental planes use the same techniques.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why? I don't understand. There's no reason.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're right about that. There's no need for all this
radar-evasive design, all these special materials. Unless . . .&quot; He
paused, then checked below to make sure that no technicians were within
earshot. &quot;Last night, when I took her down, I maintained the yaw at ninety
degrees, making sure their tracking antenna at Katsura could only see the
underside of the fuselage. And guess what. The real story slipped out there at
the meeting. This plane just vanished off their radar screens. Disappeared. But
now Ikeda knows I know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The elder Androv stared at him. For years people had told him
his son was too smart to be a jet jockey. They were right. All these years he'd
never given him enough credit. &quot;I think I'm beginning to understand what
you're saying. For a space platform to have—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Exactly. The underside of this vehicle has an almost</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>nonexistent
radar signature. Probably about like a medium-sized bird. All you'd have to do
is darken it some more and it's gone. Now what the hell's the purpose?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The elder Androv didn't respond immediately. He was still
puzzling over the staff meeting. He'd never seen the project director so upset.
Admittedly Yuri had violated procedures and violated them egregiously, but
still . . . Ikeda's flare of anger was a side of the man not previously
witnessed by anybody on the Soviet team.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Also, he continued to wonder at their sudden rush to a
hypersonic test flight. Pushing it ahead by months had created a lot of
fast-track problems. Why was Mino Industries suddenly in such a hurry? And now,
this mystery. Yuri was right. An air-breathing orbital platform for near-space
research didn't need to evade radar. The world would be cheering it, not
shooting at it. Very puzzling. And troubling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yuri, you've got a point. None of this makes any
sense.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Damned right it doesn't. And there's more. You should
see the ECM equipment on this thing, the electronic countermeasures for
defeating hostile surveillance and defense systems. It's all state of the
art.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Andrei Androv's dark eyes clouded. &quot;Why wasn't I informed
of any of this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your propulsion team, your aeronautics specialists, all
your technical people have been given green eyeshades and assigned neat little
compartments. Nobody's getting the whole picture. Besides, I don't know anybody
here who's really on top of the latest classified Stealth technology.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, the truth is none of us has had time to think
about it.&quot; The old man had never seemed older.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me tell you a secret.&quot; Yuri lowered his voice
to something approaching a whisper. &quot;Lemontov has thought about it. Our
little project <i>kurirovat</i>, that CPSU hack, thinks he's going to take this
plane back home and copy the design to build a fleet of hypersonic—whatever you
want to call these—invisible death machines, maybe. He hinted as much to me
about four nights ago.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I absolutely won't hear of it.&quot; Andrei Androv's
eyes were grim with determination.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My dear father,&quot; Yuri used the affectionate
Russian diminutive, &quot;you may not have a damned thing to say about it. I'm
convinced Lemontov or whoever gives him his orders has every intention of
trying to convert this vehicle into a weapons delivery system, and Mino
Industries, I also now believe, has already built one. Right here. It's ready
to go. But whichever way, space research is way down everybody's list. So the
real question is, who's going to try and fuck who first?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I guess the last person able to answer that question is
me.&quot; The old man's eyes were despondent as he ran his fingers through his
long mane of white hair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yuri laughed and draped his arm around his father once again.
&quot;Well, nobody else around here seems to know either. Or care.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But what are we going to do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've got a little plan cooking. I don't want to talk
about it now, but let's just say I'm going to screw them all, count on
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When Michael Vance walked into the third-floor trading room
of Kenji Nogami's Westminster Union Bank, it had just opened for morning
business. Computer screens were scrolling green numbers; traders in
shirtsleeves were making their first calls to Paris and Zurich; the pounds and
dollars and deutsche marks and yen were starting to flow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nogami, in a conservative charcoal black suit, nervously led
the way. His glassed-in office was situated on the corner, close to the floor
action, with only a low partition to separate him from the yells of traders and
the clack of computers. It was his Japanese style of hands-on management, a oneness
with the troops. England, the land that virtually invented class privilege, had
never seen anything remotely comparable with this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But there was something ominous about his mood as he rang for
morning tea. Vance noticed it. The openness of the previous afternoon was gone,
replaced by a transparent unease.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A uniformed Japanese &quot;office lady&quot; brought their
brew, dark and strong, on a silver service with thin Wedgewood cups.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance needed it. His nightcap with Eva at the Savoy had
lasted almost two hours, but when it was finished, part of the play was in
place. First thing this morning, still recovering from last night's encounter,
they had shared a pot of English Breakfast, and then she'd gone back to work on
the translation of the protocol. He was still waking up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, I received a reply.&quot; All Nogami's
synthetic British bonhomie had evaporated. &quot;I think he is willing to talk.
However, there are terms. And his people want to see you. He also mentioned
'all parties.' I take it others are involved.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There is someone else.&quot; His hangover was
dissipating rapidly now, thanks to the tea. &quot;But I think she's had all the
contact she's going to have with his 'people.' &quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nogami glanced up sharply. &quot;I don't know what this is
about, but the meeting could be held on neutral ground. I assure you there
would be nothing to fear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell him he can forget it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're free to telex back your own conditions.&quot; He
shrugged, then tried to smile. &quot;I'm merely the messenger here. I have no
idea what this is about and I don't think I really want to know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll try my best to keep you out of it, but that may
not be entirely possible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, I've handled my part of our bargain. I've set
up the dialogue.&quot; Nogami's voice was barely audible above the din of
traders. &quot;What about yours?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm still working on it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There isn't much time.&quot; His brow wrinkled.
&quot;Some kind of preliminary offering has to be scheduled tomorrow, the day
after at the latest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, why not get rolling? Doing that should help smoke
out an answer for you. For everybody.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If the bonds are really—but first let's see what
Tokyo's got to say. Is there a deal or not?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps his reply will give you some idea.&quot; He removed
a shiny sheet of paper from a manila envelope and passed it over. &quot;It's
why I rang you so early. It was telexed here, using our secure lines, during
the night. See what you make of it. I must admit I find it a trifle
cryptic.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Vance took the sheet, it reminded him fleetingly of the
'paper' Alex Novosty had given him that morning atop the Acropolis. The heading
was exactly the same. Yep, he thought, we've hit paydirt. Across the top was
one line of type, bold and assertive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

sheet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you want to reply, you can use our telex here, just
as he asks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, how good is his word? If he agrees to lay off,
will he stick to it? Or should I be expecting a double cross?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know his style of operation pretty well. What do
you think? For my own part, I've always been able to trust him. He has a
reputation for doing what he says.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe that's all about to change. He's always played
for big stakes, but this time it's a whole new level. It's global, and I've got
a feeling he's not going to let niceties stand in the way. It could be his last
big score.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And the Eurodollar debentures he wants me to underwrite?&quot;
Nogami studied him. &quot;You already know what they're for, don't you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think I might have a rough idea.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I suspected as much,&quot; he sighed. &quot;All right
then, how do you want to handle this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;To begin with, no direct contact. Everything goes
through third parties. You can send the reply. I'm not going to start out using
his rules. Bad precedent. And I want him to know that if anything happens to
either of us, he gets nailed. The protocol goes to the newspapers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The protocol?&quot; Nogami's brow furrowed again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He'll know what I mean. We just need to use the
word.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you wish. And the message?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That if he'll keep his end of the bargain and lay off,
then he can access the money. But part of the deal is, I plan to keep a line on
it, at least for the time being.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;To start out, it's going to be handled in the
tried-and- true hot-money way. The hundred million will be used to purchase
British gilts, which will then be held here at the bank and used as collateral
for a loan.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The standard laundry cycle,&quot; Nogami smiled.
&quot;Almost makes me nostalgic for the old days.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's only going to be standard up to a point. After
that the setup gets a twist. The loan will then be used to acquire a special
hundred-million first issue of those Mino Industries corporate debentures
you're supposed to float, to be bought entirely by me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And thus he gets his funds, all freshly laundered and
clean and untraceable,&quot; Nogami nodded approvingly. &quot;Style, Michael,
style. You always—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes and no. You see, I never really let go. Instead of
ten- year zero-coupons, those debentures are going to be a little unique—they'll
be redeemable at any time by the holder, on twenty-four hours' notice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And you'll be the holder?&quot; Nogami suddenly seemed
considerably less pleased.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Only indirectly. I'll assign power-of-attorney to a
third party. If any unfortunate 'accidents' happen to me or to another
individual I'll specify, the bonds will be redeemed immediately. And if he
defaults, doesn't pony up the full hundred million on the spot, he can kiss the
rest of his big scheme good-bye, because a default by Mino Industries would
make the front page of the Financial Times. He won't be able to give away the
rest of that bogus paper. He's instant history in this town.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael.&quot; Nogami's frown deepened. &quot;I've
never heard of—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He gets his money, all right, but I retain a firm grip
on his <i>cojones</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Those are pretty rugged terms. I doubt he'll
agree.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's the only way we play. He gets his money, cleaned,
but I come away with a hundred-million-dollar insurance policy. I hope we can
do business, because otherwise he'll never see those funds, period.
Guaranteed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then if you'll word the language the way you want it,
I'll transmit it.&quot; He paused. &quot;But I can tell you right now he will
not be happy. This is very irregular. Also, I'm not sure I want to start
issuing those Mino Industries debentures, no matter what their maturities. Once
on that road, how will I ever turn back? You're putting me on the spot
here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'll be taken care of. Look, Ken, we can't stop the
man from selling phony Mino Industries paper to European suckers. Nobody can.
If you back away, he'll just make an end run around you and arrange it some
other way. We both know that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what am I supposed to do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Set up what I want, to get me some leverage. I'll take
it from there. It's not just the hundred million he'll have hanging over his
head. There's also the protocol I mentioned. I want him to know I'm in a
position to go public with it if he doesn't lay off. That, together with the
threat of exposing his plan to defraud Eurodollar tax dodgers, should be enough
to keep him in line.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Whatever you say.&quot; He looked dubious. &quot;But
I'm convinced nothing is going to go forward without a meeting. There'll be no
getting around it.&quot;</span></p>

parked on the side street behind the Savoy, just above Victoria Embankment

was part of the deal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

you'll have your hundred million back and maybe you can go home again in one
piece. I'm saving your two-timing Russian ass, for chrissake, so I expect a
little gratitude.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

He was lighting a cigarette. After the black lighter clicked shut, he peered
through the cloud of smoke. &quot;But what about you? Where can you go when
this house of cards collapses? You know it will. It has to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Eva and I'll both be out of here too, God
willing.&quot; He paused, his mind racing. &quot;Okay, now tell me what else
you know about this prototype.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Novosty's voice was weary. &quot;You guessed correctly. I've
been afraid to talk about it to anybody, but now . . . you're right, it's an
advanced airplane. That's all I know for sure. The word I hear is that it's
faster than anything the world has ever seen. Much faster. A marvel of high
technology.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We suspected that, from the runway.&quot; He glanced
out the tinted windows. The late morning above the Thames was still only a
glimmer through the misty haze. &quot;Exactly how fast is it supposed to
be?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Many, many times the speed of sound. Ten, maybe even
twenty, who knows. I think the project is at least a decade ahead of the U.S.
or Europe. It's almost ready for a first full test flight, or so I understand.
Needless to say, it's supposedly intended for peaceful uses, space research,
but—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Get serious. Tanzan Mino plays for keeps, all the way.
And you were laundering the seed money for the deal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When I got involved I had no idea.&quot; Novosty drew
on his cigarette. &quot;I swear it. When Viktor Fedorovich Volodin asked me to
help, he said it was merely part of a secret trade agreement. The hardliners
were being kept out of it. Now I realize he probably didn't know the real story
either.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It was only later that I pieced together the rest.
About the prototype and its capabilities.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Figure it out. Mino Industries is about to become the
ultimate arms supplier to the world, sole retailer of the newest must-have
weapon, and the Soviets and the Americans get to join each other neck-and-neck
in a 'debt race,' buying them up. Your military is just like ours; they never
saw a new weapons system they didn't like.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Inevitably.&quot; He was trying to keep his composure.
&quot;But I don't see how you can stop it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're going to start by nailing the godfather in his
tracks, and you're part of the team. So you've got to keep yourself together.
Remember our agreement last night, what you have to do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, Tanzan Mino is running out of time. I hear
that the prototype can't be unveiled, or the protocol brought before the Diet
for a vote, until the powers in the Liberal Democratic Party are well placated.
This time it's not just insider stock trading info he's giving out, it's laundered
cash. Since the money's still here in London, he's very upset.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You say you think the whole thing is scheduled to go
forward in less than a week.&quot; Vance studied him. &quot;But it's possible
only if the hundred million is there, in hand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bribes, my friend. Or as they call it, <i>kosaihi</i>.
All the way up and down the line.&quot; He smiled wryly and rubbed at his
beard. &quot;Michael, you of all people should know how things work over there.
Very little has changed, really, from the old days when the CIA was running
half of Japan's politicians. It's an honorable tradition to take care of the
right people. But the timing is crucial.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No <i>kosaihi</i> payoffs, no deal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;That's what I hear. Everybody knows the Diet
is a rubber stamp. Everything is decided at the top, a 'consensus' among the
leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party. But the behind-the-scenes powers in
the LDP refuse to endorse such a controversial prospect, a partnership with
Russia, unless it's worth their while. At least that's what I hear. So the
payoff money must be distributed, in tidy untraceable bundles with fancy
gift-wrappings and bows. It's the traditional way, Michael. The dictates of
proper etiquette. You know the system.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then it shouldn't be too hard to deal with the man at
the top. He's in a bind.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I seriously doubt he will be in a mood for compromise
this time. He's used to getting what he wants, no questions asked.&quot;
Novosty's dark eyes were knowing. &quot;I shouldn't think that would be news to
you, considering how you—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It has a familiar ring. But this time maybe it'll be
different.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, I'm in a hopeless position. You know that. If
the funds aren't delivered to Tokyo, and soon, God only knows what will happen.
But if I don't return the money to Moscow, I am also a dead man. I don't see
any realistic way out of this. Either way I'm finished. There is no way a
hundred million dollars can be in two places at once.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Smoke and mirrors, like you said, smoke and
mirrors.&quot; He shoved the key into the ignition and the engine roared to
life. &quot;Look, we're dealing with perceptions now. And a tight schedule.
When this thing explodes, the money's going to be the least of anybody's
problems.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're right. There's also the matter of the protocol.
If it's leaked before the treaty is formally announced, I'll be blamed. We'll
be blamed. He will track us to the ends of the earth. You know it and I know
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

bluff.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

&quot;Getting even this much for you was not easy. None of this is happening

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

there was indeed an overweight Russian security man standing there, wearing an
ill-fitting telephone repairman's coveralls. His looks wouldn't have deceived
anybody, but maybe that was the point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She waited till Vera Karanova disappeared into the elevator

look very competent, but he was probably better than nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

was there to make sure they didn't check out and disappear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, back to work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>She closed the door and locked it. Then she took a
deep breath, clicked on the Zenith, and called up the active file.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The part of the protocol she'd translated this morning had
begun expanding on the elements of the pending deal. The Soviets were agreeing
to open their space program completely to the Japanese, effectively making it a
joint venture. In return, Mino Industries and the Japanese government would
join with the USSR to create a new trade bloc comprising all the Asian economic
dynamos that currently were allies of the United States.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Russia shared some islands, along with its space expertise,
and in return it got bottomless financing—and a trading axis with Japan that
would, eventually, totally undermine America's hegemony in the Pacific. The new
economic alliance, an Orwellian Eastasia, would have the USSR as one superpower
cornerstone, Japan the other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. . . 7.
Within sixty days of the formal delivery of the prototype, the USSR will
provide representatives of Mino Industries Group with full and unrestricted access
to all facilities at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The space program of the USSR
will be integrated with that of Japan—all personnel, equipment, and launch
facilities being operated thereafter as a single, unified entity. Future costs
of the combined space program will be borne equally by Japan and the USSR. Japanese
satellites and Japanese astronauts subsequently will be launched from either
the Baikonur Cosmodrome or the Tanegeshima Space Center as schedules mandate.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>8. Although the level of Japanese-Soviet trade is currently
twice that between the United States and the Soviet Union, it accounts for only
1.5 percent of total Japanese overseas trade. Through joint ventures arranged
by Mino Industries Group, this amount will be increased over the ensuing
five-year period to a sum representing not less than ten percent of all
Japanese foreign trade. All tariff barriers between the USSR and Japan will be
phased out over the same five-year period.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

USSR will join with Mino Industries Croup to begin governmental and private
steps toward establishing a Pacific Basin tariff-free trade zone encompassing
the USSR, Japan, South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Hong Kong,
Singapore, and Indonesia. All offices, contracts, and trade agreements currently
held by Mino Industries Croup will henceforth be reopened to encompass the
representatives and interests of the USSR. . . .</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It boggled Eva's mind. The alliance might be partly military,
but the Japanese and the Soviets were no fools. They realized full well that
the real battleground of the next century would be an economic struggle, with
the ultimate aim of every country being to surpass the United States.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stared at the blue screen, mesmerized. This secret
protocol was a detailed battle plan whereby the Soviets and the Japanese
provided each other exactly what they'd need to emerge as the dominant
superpowers of the twenty-first century. Synergism in high-tech, control of
space, a trade bloc, a defense alliance—all of it was there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But governments weren't that smart. They usually had to be
dragged into doing what was sensible strategically. Which meant that this whole
scenario had to be the brainchild of some private genius. Only one man in
Japan, according to Michael, had the money and clout to put a deal like this

color:windowtext'>&quot;Sato-sama, <i>ohayo gozaimasu</i>.&quot; Kenji Nogami
rose, then bowed low as Jiro Sato and his dark-suited bodyguard were ushered
into the Westminster Union Bank's upstairs dining room. The walls were ice
gray, with a gold-leafed Momoyama screen depicting a fierce eagle perched on a
pine branch mounted on one side. On the other was a modern oil painting, an
impressionistic rendering of the rising sun of the Japanese flag. Both were
symbols intended to impress Nogami's City guests with Japan's new financial
power.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Ohayo</i>.&quot; Jiro Sato nodded lightly in return,
signifying his superior rank. In the floor-to-ceiling mirror at the far end of
the room his light-grey hair had turned to blue steel in the subdued lighting.
It now matched the hardness of his eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jiro Sato, born in Osaka sixty years ago, was the <i>Mino-
gumi's </i>London <i>oyabun</i>, the man in charge. He had lean cheeks and wore
a pin-striped suit and dark sunglasses that further camouflaged his already
expressionless eyes. His dark felt hat almost looked like a bowler. Although
that traditional City headwear was no longer de rigueur in London's financial
district, had it been, he most certainly would have worn one. Blending in was
what he was all about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nogami waited until his guest had settled into one of the
molded birch chairs at the end of the long oak table, then he seated himself
and clapped for sake. The banker's personal chef, a licensed artisan he had
stolen from Tokyo's exclusive Edo Club, was already preparing raw <i>fugu</i>,
the sometimes-lethal blowfish, to be served with scorching <i>wasabi</i> on
rare Shino ware. It was a Japanese power lunch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jiro Sato's career and that of Kenji Nogami had been entwined
for thirty years. They had always been in charge of Tanzan Mino's financial
matters, had never worked at street level. No tattoos, no missing finger
digits. They were part of the brains, not the brawn, of the <i>Mino-gumi</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Although they both knew that a certain bond issue of
a hundred billion Eurodollars was the purpose of the luncheon, they gave no
hint as their traditional small talk began with saucers of sake and a learned
discussion of the Momoyama screen on the wall, thought to have been commissioned
by the shogun Toyotomi Hideyoshi at the end of the sixteenth century. From
there their chat expanded to the glories of Momoyama art, then the
&quot;nightingale&quot; floors of Shogun Hideyoshi's Kyoto palace—beveled
boards designed to announce silent intruders—and finally to Hideyoshi's
betrayal at the hands of Ieyasu Tokugawa. The oblique topics were standard, the
Japanese way of beginning a business meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jiro Sato's official position was CEO of the London-based
Nippon Shipbuilding Company. In that role he supervised the <i>Mino-gumi's</i>
London interests with an iron hand, as was expected by those who served him,
and by his superiors in Tokyo. Nippon Shipbuilding built no ships, nor had it
for twenty years. Instead it laundered Tanzan Mino's hot money. Funds flashed
daily over the satellite link from Tokyo, and investments ranged from real
estate to British gilts to the most arcane products of the financial markets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Money laundering was but the latest enterprise of the Yakuza,
an ancient brotherhood rooted in over three hundred years of Japanese history.
The <i>kana </i>symbols for the syllables Ya-Ku-Za were the same as those for
the numbers eight, nine, and three—a total of twenty, which was a losing number
in Japanese gaming. The losers: that was what the Japanese underworld, with
ironic humility, had chosen to call itself. In earlier centuries the Yakuza
were carnival operators, gamblers, fast-moving purveyors of questionable wares.
They also took it upon themselves to be a kind of private militia, protecting a
defenseless citizenry from the predations of aristocratic warlords. They were,
in their own minds at least, Robin Hoods who championed the common man, while
also, not incidentally, catering to his penchant for entertainment, excitement,
and sin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>These days the Yakuza considered themselves the last heirs of
the samurai, but they still supplied escapism, be it in the form of nightclubs,
gambling, or amphetamines. And in so doing they had grown fabulously rich. Jiro
Sato's job in London was to reinvest and clean a portion of that wealth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nippon Shipbuilding was headquartered in an eight- story
building in the new Docklands redevelopment, yet another expensive
architectural nonentity in that multi-billion-dollar new city on the banks of
the Thames downriver from the financial district. It was, in many ways, the perfect
location for a Yakuza beachhead. Unlike the older parts of London, Docklands
was ready-made for the parvenu, since everything there was new and anonymous,
yet it stood only minutes away from the City—the best of both worlds. The
London operation was going well, and with the recent construction of their new
Docklands financial complex, at a cost of fifty million pounds sterling,
matters were on a solid footing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jiro Sato's relations with Kenji Nogami had, until today,
been conducted within the strict social dictates of Yakuza etiquette. As the
London <i>oyabun</i>, he had, in fact, bent the rules in journeying into the
City for their meeting today. Convention required that Nogami should have come
to him. However, a recent turn of events necessitated a new concern with
discretion. A muckraking series in the Telegraph two months before had accused
the Nippon Shipbuilding Company of being an organized-crime front. Consequently
he now had to take pains not to connect his own operations with the workings of
Westminster Union. It was better all around if Kenji Nogami were not seen
entering the Docklands office by some snooping newspaper hack. Nogami was a
useful asset who needed to be kept above press speculation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Also, Jiro Sato was beginning to wonder if the banker would
actually have come. Kenji Nogami was rapidly losing touch with the old ways.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>None of this would ever have been known from the light talk
at lunch. It was only when the meal was over, and the staffers had discreetly
absented themselves with deep bows, that things finally got down to matters at
hand. But even then, as tradition required, the opening was Japanese and
indirect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nogami-san,&quot; Sato Jiro said as he leaned back and
reached for his fifth go of sake, &quot;do you recall the famous story
comparing the three great shoguns who ruled during that unsettled period
surrounding the Momoyama? The tale says they each were once asked what they
would do if they had a nightingale who refused to sing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nogami nodded and sipped from his sake saucer. Of course he
knew the story. Every Japanese did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You doubtless recall that Ieyasu Tokugawa replied, 'I
will merely wait until it does sing.' He was a patient man. Toyotomi Hideyoshi,
by contrast, said he would prefer to try and reason with the bird, hoping to
convince it to sing.&quot; He paused and smiled. &quot;Sometimes gentle
persuasion does work. But the great warlord Oda Nobunaga declared he would just
ring the wretched creature's neck. He had no patience with disobedience.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps Ieyasu Tokugawa's answer was the wisest,
Sato-sama.&quot; The banker's eyes were defiant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He also enjoyed the luxury of time, Nogami-san. I suppose
the pace of affairs was more leisurely back then.&quot; Sato set down his black
<i>raku</i> sake saucer and lit a Peace cigarette, the unfiltered Japanese
brand. &quot;These days events do not always allow us such luxuries, no matter
how much we might wish it. Sometimes it is necessary to proceed
forcefully.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There is always a problem when the bird finds the song
is . . . unsuitable.&quot; Nogami again sipped from his own saucer, meeting Sato's
gaze. &quot;When the notes are discordant.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Jiro Sato listened thoughtfully, appreciating
Nogami's indirect and poetic answer. Then the banker went on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ninjo, Sato-sama. For over three centuries <i>ninjo</i>
has </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>been what made our brotherhood
unique. Are we to forget that now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They both knew what he meant. <i>Ninjo</i> was uniquely
Japanese, because no other people in the world had Japan's sense of tribal
unity. The Western terms chivalry or compassion carried only a superficial
sense of <i>ninjo</i>. It was the inborn golden rule of Japanese culture that
surfaced daily in expressions of racial togetherness, support and cooperation.
It also was a deep-seated part of the Yakuza tradition. Great <i>oyabun </i>of
the past liked to point out that the Yakuza's honoring of <i>ninjo</i> was what
set their brotherhood apart from the American Mafia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Yakuza have historically served the people,&quot;
Nogami went on. &quot;Yakuza do not run dishonest gambling tables, even if the
victims are to be gaijin. It is not the Yakuza way to perpetrate fraud, which
is what the CEO's Eurobond issue amounts to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jiro Sato did not offer to refute the assertion. Instead he
replied from a different direction, his voice soft.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There is <i>ninjo</i>, Nogami-san. And there is <i>giri</i>.
Which do you respect more?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He knew he had just presented Nogami with a hopeless dilemma.
<i>Giri</i>. It was a word no <i>gaijin </i>could ever entirely comprehend. The
closest a foreign language, or a foreign mind, could manage was
&quot;duty.&quot; But that pale concept missed entirely the reverberations of
moral obligation in <i>giri</i>. One could never fully repay such indebtedness,
even with one's life. A Japanese called it &quot;the burden hardest to
bear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A Yakuza's foremost expression of <i>giri</i> was to honor
and obey his <i>oyabun</i>. The great <i>oyabun</i> of Japan's leading Yakuza
syndicates were more than merely godfathers. They were Confucian elders,
patriarchs, wisdom figures who embodied all the traditions of the clan. Their
authority was absolute and unquestioned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kenji Nogami owed as much <i>giri </i>to Tanzan Mino as any
man could. The Tokyo <i>oyabun</i> had made him everything he was; it was an
obligation he could never fully discharge. One look at his face told how his
heart was torn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But as Jiro Sato studied Nogami's pained eyes, he was</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>torn as
well. Tokyo was near to losing confidence in him. The CEO had just announced by
telex that a team of <i>kobun </i>had been posted to London to
&quot;assist.&quot; But if the <i>oyabun’s</i> Tokyo people had to step in and
solve the problem, a lot more would be lost than finger digits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally Nogami spoke, his voice firm. &quot;Perhaps you will
be pleased to learn, Sato-sama, that I am prepared to make certain preliminary
accommodations. An initial offering of Eurobonds will be formally issued
tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is a wise decision.&quot; Jiro Sato tried to
disguise his surge of relief beneath a mask of unconcern. Nogami was going to
go along after all!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It will be for one hundred million Eurodollars,&quot;
the banker continued. &quot;And it is already fully subscribed, in
advance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Only one hundred million?&quot; Sato felt his iron
facade crack. &quot;What purpose—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;It will provide the immediate funds I
understand are now needed. After that, we can discuss further steps.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Further steps? Sato thought. Yes, the Tokyo <i>oyabun </i>would
definitely see to it that there were further steps. His bird would sing. Or
else. Kenji Nogami was acting as though obligation, giri, had ceased to exist.
But such things were not possible. Giri lasted forever. Did Nogami think the
old ways no longer counted for anything?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The debentures will be purchased by an American investor,&quot;
Nogami went on, his voice cutting through the silence. &quot;His name is
Vance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have heard of him already.&quot; Sato felt his anger
boil. Vance, he knew, had the <i>oyabun’s</i> hundred million and was trying to
hold the entire scenario ransom. What he hadn't known until this instant was
that Kenji Nogami was helping him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, he thought, perhaps the two problems can be solved
simultaneously. An example is going to be made of Vance, an example that will
also serve to provide a certain recalcitrant bird a needed refresher course in <i>giri</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, Jiro Sato thought, the CEO's <i>kobun </i>from Tokyo are
going to arrive to find their work has been done. Enough face has been lost,
not to mention three men. The situation is intolerable. The only way to regain
the London office's tattered honor, to avenge its disgrace, is to resolve the
Vance situation immediately.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The townhouse was in the quiet residential South Kensington

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

London oyabun here this afternoon. About postponing the rest of the issue. He
was not pleased. It's been a bad week for him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The long arm of the Tokyo <i>oyabun</i>. Plenty of

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>&quot;It's not just that.&quot; Nogami was
inserting a large key into the front door, white with Georgian decorations and
a leaded glass transom above. &quot;You understand the kind of obligation we
Japanese must bear for past favors. It's onerous, but all the same it's very
real. We can't just say thanks for the memories.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Giri</i>.&quot; Vance nodded. &quot;The 'burden.'
&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Ah, you know. Yes, it's called <i>giri </i>and
there's nothing we can do about it.&quot; He was switching on the hall light.
&quot;<i>Giri </i>rules our lives.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance noticed the floor had a pristine carpet in conservative
gray. A polished mahogany staircase led to the upper floors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nice, Ken, very nice. The quintessential banker's
pad.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have the entire building, my little indulgence. I
keep a few antiques here, some of my art. You know, special things.
Unfortunately I don't have a chance to use it much these days. The . . . friend
I used to meet here . . . well, her husband was transferred back to Osaka. And
I haven't had time to come up with a replacement.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;First things first, Ken. You should always make time
for living. One of my few rules in life. You never get another shot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He laughed and opened the door leading from the hallway into
the parlor suite. It smelled slightly musty from disuse. &quot;I'm better at
giving advice than taking it too, old man.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Touche.&quot; Vance shrugged, then looked around the
spacious drawing room. It was furnished in standard English style, with
overstuffed chairs, a Victorian fireplace, an oak tea caddy and bar. But the
nineteenth-century appointments weren't what concerned him. Was it safe?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, we both may need this place if your plan
doesn't work. I don't know where else I can go.&quot; He walked to the bar, a
collection of bottles on the bottom tray of the caddy, and selected a flask of
cognac. &quot;Now could you repeat that story again? About the protocol. I must
confess I'm dazzled.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the limousine driving up from Westminster Union, Vance had
finally told him the real purpose of the bond issue, what the money was going
to be used for. The banker had listened in silence, stunned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, to make a long story short, you're being used, in
what's probably going to be the biggest shell game in history. Tanzan Mino
steals unsecured billions from European tax evaders and uses it to finance the
opening of Russia's markets for Mino Industries. You're right to bail out now.
If he pulls it off, he'll look like a genius. But if it backfires and the truth
comes out, you'll get full credit. Not exactly a terrific downside.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I didn't get this far exposing myself unnecessarily,
and I don't intend to start now. Not for him or anybody.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then we'll proceed with Plan A.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This reminds me a lot of the old days.&quot; He laughed
and poured a snifter for each of them. &quot;Here's to the end of <i>giri</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And the beginning of a new life.&quot; Vance clicked
their glasses, then took a sip. &quot;Now, we need to get our coordination
synchronized.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Everything is ready at my end. Tomorrow morning I'll
issue the zero-coupon debentures you're going to purchase, and you'll make the
trade. After that I'll wire your hundred million to Tokyo, and Tanzan Mino is
taken care of.  I've simultaneously arranged with Sumitomo Bank to accept that
paper as collateral for a loan. You'll get the money from them on the spot. By
the way, how do you want it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just park it in gilts, through the trading desk at
Moscow Narodny Bank, the new branch on Saint Swithins Lane.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Done,&quot; Nogami nodded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now how about the debentures that are Sumitomo's
security? And mine. Who's holding them?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We Japanese still act like gentlemen, Michael. At least
up to a point. They've agreed to let me hold them until we close our books at
the end of the month. I did them a similar favor last year.&quot; He sipped at
his brandy with satisfaction. &quot;So you can still call them anytime if, God
help us, it comes to that. You'll have your leverage, and Tanzan Mino will know
it. If you should have to call them and he defaults, he'll then have to answer
to Sumitomo. And he wouldn't dare. I happen to know they hold a forty-million-
dollar mortgage on his new office building down in the Docklands. They'd eat
him and not even blink. There's some bad blood between them, though I don't
know exactly what it is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, so far, so good.&quot; Vance looked around the
room. &quot;You're absolutely positive nobody knows about this place?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's been my little secret for four years now. I paid
cash and I don't even report the expenses on my tax forms, which gives you some
idea how I value my privacy. So there's absolutely no way anybody could know
about it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You never came here in your limo?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Only if I came without a driver, the way we did
today.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then it sounds clean.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This place is the least of your worries, Michael.&quot;
He settled into a chair. &quot;After my meeting this afternoon, I have an idea
that the London <i>oyabun</i>, Jiro Sato, has every intention of taking things
into his own hands . . . to try and break me. He's going to push the pace—in
swordsmanship it's called <i>mukatsu kasuru to iu koto</i>. He's lost too much
face. He can't let you get away with this and still control the organization.
After the debacle in Greece, he's near to becoming a laughing stock among his
own <i>kobun</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Can't Tokyo manage him?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Theoretically. But the organization is getting a little
far-flung these days. I don't know. My instincts tell me he's going to
undertake some face-saving on his own. Just temporarily overlook any agreement
you may have with the front office.&quot; He rose and splashed some more brandy
into his glass. &quot;It's going to get rough, that's all I know for sure. So
the sooner you proceed with the rest of your plan, the better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Everything's ready.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I suppose it's time we wished each other well and
got going.&quot; Nogami finished off his brandy and dug the keys from his
pocket. He jangled them a moment in his hand, then tossed them over. &quot;Take
them now. You might as well secure the place as we leave and start getting used
to that tricky front door lock. There won't be any time to practice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Here's to you, Ken.&quot; Vance saluted him with the
snifter,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>then drained
it. &quot;And many thanks. If you ever owed me any <i>giri</i>, consider it
paid.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That works both ways. I'm doing myself a favor too. I
had to make a break, if this financing double cross of his backfires, it could
turn into a worldwide scandal. I'd be ruined. Not to mention Westminster Union,
which the regulators here would probably padlock. With scarcely concealed glee.
It would merely confirm what everybody here wants to think about those
'win-at-any-cost' Japanese these days.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I appreciate it. I mean that. I'm sorry we didn't
get to know each other better over the years.&quot; Vance tried locking the
front door. It was difficult, as Nogami had warned, but finally it clicked
securely. Outside the evening air was brisk, with a few of Nogami's neighbors
stoically walking large dogs and pretending to enjoy the ambience of London's
chilly dusk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If we both live long enough, maybe we can try. You're
one of the few Westerners I've known who ever really understood Japan.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I had a crash course several years back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So I understand.&quot; He smiled as he opened the limo
door. Vance would drive. &quot;Which is one of the reasons I wonder if this
arrangement is going to be as simple as we'd hoped. Tanzan Mino has a long
memory, Michael. He doesn't forgive or forget. I'm sure he still remembers you
were responsible for shutting down his cozy CIA arrangement.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I thought it was time the Company cleaned up its act.
But hell, that was almost eight years ago.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's a mere snap of the fingers in Japanese time, as
you well know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, fuck him if he can't take a joke.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A joke is the one thing he can't take, my friend. He
never smiles unless there's a camera around.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, you say he's agreed to deal. Let's assume for now
he means it, but in the meantime we proceed as planned. You trust your mother,
but you cut the cards.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nogami settled into the seat and shut the door. Then he
looked down quizzically. &quot;What's this? I didn't notice it before.&quot; He
reached down and picked up a black leather sachel off the floor, testing its
weight. &quot;Somehow I've got a feeling it's not a new tie from Harrods.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As it happens, that's a little housewarming gift from
the Soviet embassy. Part of my deal, along with the car. It's registered and
legal, or so they tell me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My God.&quot; He settled it back on the floor. &quot;I
must be getting old. Hardware terrifies me these days. I'm not used to working
this close to the street anymore.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's only till we take care of business. You handle
your end tomorrow and we're both clear. At least for now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If it was really that simple, you wouldn't need
this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The point is not to need this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My friend, if Jiro Sato breaks rank and moves on us,
we're going to need twenty of these. And more.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A KGB security squad was posted at the hotel, around
ten o'clock this morning, Sato-sama. They are armed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Saaa</i>,&quot; he hissed an exhale of displeasure
and leaned forward, an unlit cigarette in his mouth. One of the black-suited <i>kobun
</i>immediately stepped up and flicked a lighter. He inhaled, then leaned back.
&quot;I'd hoped this could be handled without any fuss. But we still must proceed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your decisions are always correct, Sato-sama.&quot; The
second <i>kobun </i>bowed. &quot;But perhaps it might be wise to discuss the
possibility of waiting for the backup team from Tokyo, if only to convince
ourselves they are not needed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This office lost much face because of our problems in
Greece. There's only one way to regain it. We have to act now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Worst of all, I've lost face too, Jiro Sato reminded himself,
among my own <i>kobun</i>. An <i>oyabun </i>has to lead. The minute he shows
weakness, he's through. Buddha only knows what would happen if I lost control
here. There's no turning back. An example has to be made of the American
meddlers, if only to make Nogami-san understand the organization still means
business.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Tokyo <i>oyabun's </i>daring project is going to succeed.
In the long run it's inevitable. The problems now are short-term. But if
anything else goes wrong with this office's responsibilities . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The <i>kobun</i>, five in all, bowed respectfully. They understood
his thoughts as clearly as if they had been projected in neon across the back
wall. The office had already lost three men. Face was at stake. This problem
could not be solved from Tokyo. It was time to draw together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The operation was scheduled to begin at 11:00 P.M. sharp. The
five <i>kobun</i> had already synchronized their digital watches and stashed
their H&amp;K automatics in the two gray Fords now waiting in the building's
underground garage. No flashy limousines tonight; the operation would be lowest
of low profiles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Three more of their team were already at the hotel, with
walkie-talkies, monitoring the entrances. The KGB security in the lobby would
be quietly diverted and then neutralized. The guard upstairs would simply be
overpowered, or taken out with a silencer if the situation got out of hand.
Since they were professionals, however, matters rarely went that far.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The time had come to move. All five lined up in front of Jiro
Sato's massive oak desk and bowed to the waist; then one by one they filed out.</span></p>

of. No violence, no bloodshed. The bottle should take care of the situation.
All the same, he had a 9mm automatic in a shoulder holster. Life had taught him
that when something could go wrong, chances were good that it would.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After this one last job, he was going to disappear. The
situation had deteriorated far past where any reasonable man would want to
touch it. The time had come to bail out and let the chips fall. One more day,
that was all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Standing now at the side entrance of the Strand Palace, the
small alleyway named Burleigh that curved around the rear of the hotel and met
the main avenue, he pulled his overcoat tighter and glanced down at his Piaget.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It read 10:28. Time to get started. Everything was
synchronized down to seconds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd already made sure the service entrance was unlocked.
He'd taped the latch on the metal door during the comings and goings of the
staff during the evening shift change. Now all he had to do was slip through
and the rest should go like clockwork.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In he went. The neon-lit hallway was empty, again according
to plan. This was a slow time for all the staff except room service and the
kitchen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He slipped off his overcoat and threw it into a large laundry
hamper parked halfway down the hall. Underneath he was wearing the uniform of a
Strand Palace security man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He checked his watch. Sixty-five seconds . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment the door of the service elevator opened and a
tall Irishman stepped off. He was wearing the same uniform.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was a Strand Palace security guard, a real one. The worst
possible luck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The moment seemed frozen in time. However, one thing was
certain: the security guard wasn't fooled for an instant by the intruder. He
automatically grabbed one of his trouser legs and knelt with a practiced move,
reaching for the holster strapped to his ankle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The intruder was quicker. As the guard dropped down, his knee
came up, slamming against the man's square jaw. The Irishman toppled back
against the side of the elevator with a groan, but not before his fist lashed
out, aimed for the groin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was a glancing blow, and it was too late. The intruder
chopped down against his neck, disabling his left arm, then slammed his head
against the steel strut running down the center of the elevator wall. He
groaned and twitched backward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Should I just break his neck? he wondered. Just kill him now?
One twist would do it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No, he lectured himself, be a professional.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Instead he rammed the Irishman's head against the steel strut
a second time, and a third, till he felt the body go fully limp.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Not good enough, he told himself, and reached into his pocket
for the bottle. The ether was going to get more use than he'd planned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He doused the heavy cloth he'd brought along and shoved it
against the fallen figure's nostrils. He continued to hold it on the ruddy face
as he closed the elevator door and pushed the button that would take him up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't ever do that again.&quot; He drew up and swung
for her, missing and crashing against a chair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Get away from me. You're drunk.&quot; She shoved him
farther into the room, her voice trembling with anger. Then she wrenched open
the hotel room door and stumbled into the hallway. &quot;<i>Pomogethya mnye!</i>&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Their KGB guard, Igor Borisovich, was already running down
the hall, &quot;<i>Shto </i>. . .?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Help me.&quot; She seized his arm and pulled him in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mike Vance was standing in the middle of the room, weaving
shakily, now grasping a letter opener in his right hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Get the hell out of here.&quot; He started moving on
the Russian, brandishing the weapon, but stumbled and had to pause to collect
his balance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He drank half a bottle of tequila and went crazy.&quot;
She was shouting in Russian. &quot;Do something!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Igor nodded knowingly. He came from a land where alcoholism
easily edged out soccer as the national pastime.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What is problem?&quot; The hulking Soviet moved
forward, gingerly trying to retrieve the letter opener from Vance's hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Get away from me.&quot; Vance shoved him off,
then stumbled back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, you must give me knife,&quot; the Russian demanded.
&quot;We want no trouble.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nobody noticed, but the time was 10:30. Exactly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room was brought up sharp by the sound of the door
slamming and a click of the lock. They turned to see a figure wearing a black
ski mask and the uniform of a Strand Palace security guard. In his right hand
was a 9mm automatic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who the hell . . . ?&quot; Vance yelled drunkenly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Igor whirled to stare. His hand started for his shoulder
holster, but then he thought better of it and instead he backed slowly against
the wall, silently glaring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where is it?&quot; the hooded figure demanded as he
brandished his pistol toward Eva.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Fuck you, whoever you are.&quot; Vance tried to move toward
him, still grasping the letter opener.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shut up.&quot; The intruder shoved him backward,
sending him sprawling onto the couch. Then he turned to Eva. &quot;Where's the
computer?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Almost at that moment he saw it, on the writing table by the
window. Without waiting for an answer, he moved quickly and seized it by the
handle. After he'd stationed it next to the door, he waved the weapon at Eva
again and barked. &quot;Get your things. And all copies of the protocol.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Listen, you son of a bitch,&quot; Vance sputtered as he
drew himself up and moved again on the intruder. &quot;She's not going
anywhere. Now get out of here before I ram that goddam—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The intruder slammed the pistol across his face, sending him
crumpling to the floor. But now his back was turned to Igor Borisovich, who
lunged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The intruder saw the movement, reflected in the tall mirror
above the dressing table. He easily sidestepped the lumbering Russian, then
brought the pistol hard against his skull. Igor Borisovich groaned and
staggered sideways flailing for balance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The hooded figure seemed prepared. His hand plunged into a
pocket and out came a bottle whose stopper had been replaced by a wadded rag.
He flung the contents of the bottle across the Russian's face, then shoved the
soaking rag against his mouth and nostrils.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Igor Borisovich struggled and clawed limply at his face for a
few moments before lapsing unconscious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You fucker.&quot; Vance pulled himself up off the
floor, muttering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Problem?&quot; The intruder glanced at him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;One small one, yeah. You damned near broke my
jaw.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is the theater of the real, my friend,&quot; Alex
Novosty laughed as he pulled off the ski mask. &quot;If you're going to be
kidnapped, it has to look authentic. I'm a professional. I never do these
things by halves.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Any problem downstairs?&quot; Eva was already
collecting her scant belongings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, one very big problem. I had a small misunderstanding
with one of the hotel's security people. The natives here are not friendly.
He's on the service elevator now, sound asleep like this one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where did you park it?&quot; She opened the room door
and looked up and down the hall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It should still be on this floor. I put it on Emergency
Stop. But he's going to wake up any time now and sound the alarm.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then we've got to finish here and get out fast.&quot;
She slammed the door and turned back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They went to work, quickly turning over chairs, ripping
curtains, leaving evidence of a violent struggle. Belongings were strewn across
the bed and floor, as though there'd been a hasty search. It was done quietly
and efficiently and took about a minute. Novosty thoughtfully positioned his
black ski mask in the middle of the floor, just one more clue in what they
hoped would be signs of an abrupt, forced departure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then they grabbed what they needed, including the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Zenith
Turbo, locked the door, and made their way down the hallway. The Strand Palace
security guard was still on the service elevator, unconscious but beginning to
stir.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you propose we do with him?&quot; Novosty gave
the Irishman a shake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How about a little more ether,&quot; Eva suggested. She
was clasping the Zenith next to her. &quot;And then let's get out of
here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He obligingly gave the man a final dose from the almost-
empty bottle, leaving the rag across his face. By the time he finished, the
elevator had reached the service area in the basement. Their Soviet limousine
was parked in the alley, ready. In seconds they were in it and gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=bookmark55><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Michael Vance, Eva Borodin, and Aleksei Novosty were luckier
than they knew. When they emerged, the Japanese guard Jiro Sato had stationed
at the Burleigh entrance had momentarily been called away by radio to confer at
the Strand corner. Since the alleyway was curved slightly, as London alleys
invariably are, the huddled Yakuza team saw nothing but the tinted windows of a
limousine with diplomatic license plates speeding past. They paid it no heed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Watches were checked one more time, and then the dark-suited
men fanned out. The guard stationed down Burleigh returned to his post, while
the five who had been in the Docklands office made their way into the teeming
lobby on the Strand. While two started up the fire stairs, the other three
converged on the KGB guard, disarmed him discreetly, and then informed him that
he had pressing business outside. He was shoved into one of the waiting Fords,
gagged, and handcuffed to the steering column. It took less than a minute to
neutralize him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the three returned to the lobby and got on the elevator.
On the eighth floor they met the other two, who had come in from the stairway
at the opposite end of the hall. Together they swept the corridors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The KGB guard was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps they pulled the security on this floor,&quot;
one of them said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Or he has gone into the room, to piss out some
vodka,&quot; another suggested.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This will be easier than we thought,&quot; a third was
heard to observe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Together they converged on the room registered in the name of
Michael Vance, and then they stood aside as one knocked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When there was no answer, they elected to shoulder it in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they rushed the room, they were met by a fusillade of
automatic pistol fire from a boiling mad KGB security agent, nursing a headache
and crouched just inside the bathroom door.</span></p>

ruse?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who knows.&quot; He looked up from stoking the
fireplace, where nothing but embers remained. &quot;Tanzan Mino may be a
genius, but the rest of his Yakuza hoods are not exactly rocket scientists.
Ditto T-Directorate's flunkies. With any luck both sides will think the other
one's kidnapped us and they'll go after each other. That's the idea at least.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, we're pretty vulnerable.&quot; She kicked off her
shoes and leaned back on the couch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, after tomorrow Tanzan Mino won't dare send his
goons after us . . . unless he's got something up his sleeve we don't know
about.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's just it,&quot;she sighed. &quot;If he manages to
find us . . . why mince words, if he decides to try and kill us again, what
then? Will this Japanese banker friend of yours stick with us? Whose side is he
on, I mean really?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, we're here, aren't we? Nobody knows about this
place, not even Alex.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They had ditched Novosty three blocks down the Strand. Trust
had its limits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Except, of course, your Japanese banker friend. He
knows.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The only player we can rely on now is Ken. And he's the
only one—particularly after Novosty gets his money—who's got the slightest
incentive to hang tough.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm wondering what's the best way to break the story.
We've got to make sure it doesn't get away from us, get lost.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked up from the fireplace. &quot;I've already told you
what I think. I say we just go see an editor friend of mine at the Financial
Times, give him a big scoop concerning a forthcoming Mino Industries Eurobond
offering. We point out there's no collateral at all behind the debentures, and
we'll also hint there's more to it, but that angle we save for The Times of
London, which will get a nicely translated copy of the protocol. We hit the
godfather with a one-two press expose, then make ourselves scarce and let
investigative journalism do its thing. Believe me, nobody's going to ignore what
could be the biggest story of the decade. After that starts snowballing, Tanzan
Mino'll have too much on his plate to bother eating us. We'll be out of
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael,&quot; she sighed, &quot;you're a dreamer. You
don't really think it's going to be that easy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He rose and joined her on the couch, slipping his arm around
her shoulders. &quot;Maybe not, but we won't be a sitting target. We'll keep on
the move. Why don't you come and join me on the boat. I may have to postpone
visiting with the Stuttgart team down at Phaistos, but we'll find something.
It'll be simple.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sounds really simple.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All great ideas are basically that way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, if life's as simple as you make out, then why did
you insist on Alex's friends at the Soviet embassy lending you that
thing?&quot; She pointed to the black leather satchel stationed next to the
fireplace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Guess I'm nervous.&quot; He grinned weakly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean you're scared. Cut the bull. I'm scared
too.&quot; She got up, walked over and picked up the leather bag. &quot;Now, I
want you to show me how to work this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?&quot; He didn't like the idea. &quot;You
sure?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Absolutely. We're in this together.&quot; She settled
the bag down on the carpet, unzipped the top, and drew out an object whose
black matte-satin finish glistened in the soft glow of the coals. &quot;This is
an Uzi, right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The tried and true. Major Uziel Gal's contribution to
the mayhem of the world.&quot; He reached over and took it. &quot;You know,
this is an instrument of sudden death. Do you really want your finger on the
trigger?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sweetheart, just tell me what I need to know.&quot; She
met his gaze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, here goes.&quot; He still hated the thought, for
a lot of reasons. The mere sight of an Uzi reminded him of things in the past
he preferred to forget. But there clearly was no stopping her. &quot;A quick
run-through of the care and feeding of your classic assault machine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good.&quot; She reached and took it, tugging at the collapsed
metal stock a second before turning back to him. &quot;By the way, is it
loaded?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, but it probably should be. You can take care of
that yourself in just a second. But first things first.&quot; He pointed down.
&quot;See this thumb button right here, on the left top of the grip? Notice
there're three positions—all the way back is the safety, next is semiautomatic
fire, and all the way forward is full-auto. There's also a backup safety here,
at the top rear of the pistol grip. The action stays locked unless it's
depressed, which happens when you squeeze down to deliver a round.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Two safeties?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't knock it. This baby fires ten rounds a second on
full-auto. We've only got five magazines.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How many rounds in a magazine?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I insisted on the enlarged thirty-two-round version instead
of the usual twenty-five. But still, with that little button forward on
full-auto you can empty a magazine in about three seconds. It's a good way to
get the attention of everybody in the room.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Can you actually hold your aim in full-auto?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well enough. The recoil's surprisingly minimal. Remember
to fire in short bursts and you'll do okay.&quot; He pointed down. &quot;Now,
the cocking handle is this knurled knob here on the top. Notice it's got a slot
cut in it so it doesn't block the sights. You yank it back to ready it. And
don't forget, always use your left hand to cock the action and change
magazines, and your right to operate the safety-selector switch.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Got it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, now you're ready to load.&quot; He picked one of
the black rectangular metal cases out of the leather satchel on the floor.
&quot;This is a charged magazine. Always cock the action and set the thumb
switch to safety before you insert one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She pulled the knob back firmly, then pushed her thumb
against the switch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now feed the magazine into the bottom of the pistol
grip&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She shoved it in with a click and it was secured.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're ready to party. Thumb off the safety and it's a
go project.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How do you take the magazine out when it's empty?&quot;
She aimed into the fireplace. For a second he thought she was going to take out
a few half-burnt logs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's a release catch on the bottom left side of the
pistol grip. Just depress it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what about the stock? Should I bother?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He reached and took it back. &quot;You push the butt downward
to release it, and then you pull it back like this till it's fully extended and
locks.&quot; He clicked it into place, a hard sound in the silence of the
London night. &quot;To retract it you just depress this locking button here on
the left front and fold it back under again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, let me try,&quot; she said, taking it back. She
folded and unfolded it twice. &quot;Think I've got the hang of it. But do I
need it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Use it if you want to. I've always thought that when
they switched over from the original wooden stock to this metal contraption
they positioned the damned thing too high. You have to bend your head down low
to align the sights. My guess is, God forbid you should ever have to use this,
you won't have time to bother with it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Speaking of aiming, is this what I think it is?&quot;
She retrieved a small boxlike object from the bag.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;LS-45 compact laser sight. Probably useless for our
purposes, but I figured, what the hell.&quot; He reached out for her hand.
&quot;For now let's just think of all this hardware as life insurance.
Something you'd as soon never use.&quot; He took the gun and laid it on the tea
trolley. &quot;In the meantime why don't we have one last nightcap and go on up
to bed?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thought you'd never ask.&quot; She kissed him, deeply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The four-poster upstairs was canopied, the mattress downy as
a cloud. They were both hungry for each other, exhausted but deliriously free.
Perhaps it was the same relish with which a condemned prisoner consumes his
last meal, the delight in every taste, every nuance. If tomorrow brings the
prospect of death, then how much sweeter is life in the short hours before
dawn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kenji Nogami wandered alone through the bond-trading floor of
Westminster Union Bank, staring at the blank computer screens. His bank was a
member of Globex, a twenty-four-hour world-wide trading network for currency
futures, but tonight he'd ordered all his traders to square their
positions—neither short nor long—and take the night off. Then he had dismissed
the cleaning crew. He wanted to have the space entirely to himself, to think
and to reflect. Time was growing short.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>         He
settled in one of the traders' empty chairs, withdrew a stubby Cuban
Montecristo, a thick No. 2, from the breast pocket of his coat, clipped the
pointed end with a monogrammed implement, and swept a wooden match against the
floor and up to the tip with a single gesture. If we're going to have a
showdown, he thought, I might as well die with a good cigar in hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then from another pocket he took out the telex from Tokyo
that had come through just after midnight. The Tokyo <i>oyabun </i>was in a
rare frenzy. Tanzan Mino had never been thwarted like this—well, only once
before, when a certain Michael Vance, Jr., had blown the whistle on his CIA
connections.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tanzan Mino was demanding compliance. Somebody had to give
in. The obvious question: Who'd be the first to blink?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The worst he can do is kill me, Nogami thought. And he can't
do that yet. If something happens to me tonight, he won't get his hundred
million tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But then what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>You've gone this far knowing full well the consequences, he
told himself, so don't back down now. You're spitting on giri, and yet . . .
and yet it's the first thing you've ever done in your life that's made you feel
free. It's exhilarating.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Did Michael arrive safely at the South Kensington flat? He'd
toyed with the idea of calling but had decided against it. They wouldn't answer
the phone. In fact, he never answered it himself when he was there. Thinking
about it now, he wondered why he'd ever bothered to have one installed in the
first place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He drew on the Montecristo, then studied its perfect ash.
Waiting. Waiting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nogami-san, <i>sumimasen</i>,&quot; the voice sounded
down the empty room, almost an echo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They'd arrived. Finally. Why had it taken so long?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Kombanwa</i>,&quot; he replied without moving. The
cigar remained poised above his head as he continued to examine it. &quot;It is
an honor to see you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was no reply, only the sound of footsteps approaching.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He revolved in his chair to see Jiro Sato, flanked by two of
his <i>kobun</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;I see you are working late,&quot; Jiro Sato
said, examining the cigar as he nodded a stiff, formal greeting. &quot;I deeply
apologize for this inconvenience.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was expecting you,&quot; Nogami replied, nodding
back. &quot;Please allow me to make tea.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thank you but it is not required.&quot; Jiro Sato stood
before him, gray sunglasses glistening in the fluorescents. &quot;One of my <i>kobun
</i>was shot and killed tonight, Nogami-san, and two more wounded. I want to
know where to find Vance and the woman. Now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Were they responsible?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;With deepest apologies, that need not trouble
you.&quot; He stood ramrod straight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;With deepest apologies, Sato-sama, it troubles me very
much.&quot; Nogami examined his cigar. &quot;This entire affair is very
troublesome. In times past I remember a certain prejudice in favor of civility
on the part of Tokyo. Have things really changed that much?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The moment for soft words is past. Tonight ended
that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nogami drew on his cigar. &quot;Assuming you locate Vance,
what action do you propose taking?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We have one last chance here to deal with this problem.
Tomorrow the <i>oyabun's</i> people arrive, and then they will be in control.
The decisions will no longer be ours. Tonight I attempted to salvage the
situation and failed. Surely you know what that means, for us both. But if you
will give me Vance, perhaps we can both still be saved. If you refuse to
cooperate, the <i>oyabun </i>will destroy you as well as Vance. We both know
that. I am offering you a way out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;With deepest gratitude, I must tell you it is
too late, Sato-sama, which I am sure you realize,&quot; Nogami said, drawing on
his cigar and taking care not to disturb the ash. &quot;So with due respect I
must inquire concerning the purpose of this meeting.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I need to locate this man Vance. Before the <i>kobun </i>from
Tokyo arrive. If you care about his well-being, then you should remember that
his treatment at my hands will be more understanding than—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When do they arrive?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As I said, we received word that they will be here
tomorrow, Nogami-san. With respect, you have befriended a man who is attempting
to blackmail the Tokyo <i>oyabun</i>. That is a career decision which, I assure
you, is most unwise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is made. And I am aware of the consequences. So it
would appear we both know all there is to know about the future.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps not entirely. Someone has attempted to make us
think Vance and the woman were kidnapped, that they are being held somewhere
beyond our reach. Perhaps it is true, perhaps it is not. But if the transaction
for the hundred million is to take place tomorrow, then he must appear here.
The <i>oyabun's </i>people may be here by then. If they are not, we will
be.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But if he has been kidnapped,&quot; Nogami's brow furrowed
as he studied his cigar, its ash still growing, &quot;then there could be a
problem with the transaction. Who do you suppose would want him, besides the
Tokyo <i>oyabun</i>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;That I could not speculate upon. The KGB seems
to have a great interest in his activities. Perhaps they are guarding him in
some more secure place. Or perhaps something else has happened.&quot; He bowed.
&quot;Again you must forgive me for this rude intrusion. It is important for
you to be aware that the situation is not resolved. That you still have a
chance to save yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The CEO will receive his hundred million, if there is
no interference. That much I have already arranged for. When that is completed,
I will consider my responsibilities discharged.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your responsibilities will never be discharged,
Nogami-san. <i>Giri </i>lasts forever.&quot; His voice was cutting. &quot;The
sooner you realize that, the better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;After tomorrow, it will be over, Sato-sama.&quot; He
stretched out his arm and tapped the inch-long ash into a trash basket beside
the desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tomorrow,&quot; Jiro Sato bowed, &quot;it only
begins.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yuri Andreevich Androv stood facing the bulkhead that sealed
the forward avionics bays, feeling almost as though he were looking at a bank
vault. As in all high-security facilities, the access doors were controlled
electronically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since the final retrofits were now completed, the Japanese
maintenance crews were only working two shifts; nobody was around at this hour
except the security guards. He'd told them he'd thought of something and wanted
to go up and take a look at the heavy-duty EN-15 turbo pumps, which transferred
hydrogen to the scramjets after it was converted from liquid to gaseous phase
for combustion. He'd been worrying about their pulse rating and couldn't sleep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd gone on to explain that although static testing had
shown they would achieve operating pressure in twenty milliseconds if they were
fully primed in advance, that was static testing, not flight testing, and he'd
been unable to sleep wondering about the adhesive around the seals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was just technical mumbo-jumbo, although maybe he should
be checking them, he thought grimly. But he trusted the engineering team. He
had to. Besides, the pumps had been developed specially for the massive Energia
booster, and they'd functioned flawlessly in routine launchings of those
vehicles at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Of course, at Baikonur they always were initiated while the
Energia was on the launch pad, at full atmospheric pressure. On the <i>Daedalus</i>
they'd have to be powered in during flight, at sixty thousand feet and 2,700
miles per hour. But still . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The late-night security team had listened sympathetically.
They had no objection if Androv wanted to roll a stair-truck under the fuselage
of <i>Daedalus /, </i>then climb into the underbay and inspect turbo pumps in
the dead of night. Everybody knew he was eccentric. No, make that insane. You'd
have to be to want to ride a rocket. They'd just waved him in. After all, the
classified avionics in the forward bays were secured.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He smiled grimly to think that he'd been absolutely right.
Hangar Control was getting lax about security in these waning days before the
big test. It always happened after a few months of mechanics trooping in and
out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That also explained why he now had a full set of magnetic
access cards for all the sealed forward bays. Just as he'd figured, the
mechanics were now leaving them stuffed in the pockets of the coveralls they
kept in their lockers in the changing room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Time to get started.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was, naturally, double security, with a massive airlock
port opening onto a pressure bay, where three more secure ports sealed the
avionics bays themselves. The airlock port was like an airplane door, double
reinforced to withstand the near vacuum of space, and in the center was a green
metallic slot for a magnetic card.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He began trying cards, slipping them into the slot. The
first, the second, the third, the fourth, and then, payoff. The three green
diodes above the lock handle flashed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He quickly shoved down the grip and pushed. The door eased
inward, then rotated to the side, opening onto the pressure bay. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The temperature inside was a constant 5 degrees Celsius, kept
just above freezing to extend the life of the sensitive electronic gear in the
next three bays. The high-voltage sodium lamps along the sides of the fuselage
now switched on automatically as the door swung inward. He fleetingly thought
about turning them off, then realized they weren't manually operated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Through the clouds of his condensing breath he could see that
the interior of the entry bay was a pale, military green. The color definitely
seemed appropriate, given what he now knew about this vehicle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He quickly turned and, after making sure the outer door could
be reopened from the inside, closed it behind him. When it clicked secure, the
sodium lights automatically shut off with a faint hum.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just like a damned refrigerator, he thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But the dark was what he wanted. He withdrew a small penlight
from his pocket and scanned the three bulkhead hatches leading to the forward
bays. The portside bay, on the left, contained electronics for the multimode
phased array radar scanner in the nose, radar processors, radar power supply,
radar transmitters and receivers, Doppler processor, shrouded scanner tracking
mechanism, and an RF oscillator. He knew; he'd checked the engineering diagrams.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He also knew the starboard equipment bay, the one on the
right, contained signal processors for the inertial navigation system (INS),
the instrument landing system (ILS), the foreplane hydraulic actuator, the
structural mode control system (SMCS), station controller, and the pilot's liquid-oxygen
tanks and evaporator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The third forward bay, located beneath the other two and down
a set of steel stairs, was the one he needed to penetrate. It contained all the
computer gear: flight control, navigation, and most importantly, the artificial
intelligence (AI) system for pilot interface and backup.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He suddenly found himself thinking a strange thought. Since
no air-breathing vehicle had ever flown hypersonic, every component in this
plane was, in a sense, untested. To his mind, though, that was merely one more
argument for shutting down the damned AI system's override functions before he
went hypersonic. If something did go wrong, he wanted this baby on manual. He
only needed the computer to alert him to potential problems. The solutions he'd
have to work out with his own brain. And balls. After all, that's why he was
there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he walked down the steel steps, he thumbed through the
magnetic cards, praying he had the one needed to open the lower bay and access
the computers. Then he began inserting them one by one into the green metallic
slot, trying to keep his hand steady in the freezing cold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally one worked. The three encoded diodes blinked, and a
hydraulic arm automatically slid the port open. Next the interior lights came
on, an orange high-voltage sodium glow illuminating the gray walls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This third bay, like the two above it, was big enough to
stand in. As he stepped in, he glanced back up the stairs, then quickly
resealed the door. Off went the lights again, so he withdrew his penlight and
turned to start searching for what he wanted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Directly in front of him was a steel monolith with banks of
toggle switches: electrical power controls, communications controls, propulsion
system controls, reaction-control systems. Okay, that's the command console,
which was preset for each flight and then monitored from the cockpit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now where's the damned on-board AI module?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He scanned the bay. The AI system was the key to his plan. He
had to make certain the computer's artificial intelligence functions could be
completely shut down, disengaged, when the crucial moment came. He couldn't
afford for the on-board system-override to abort his planned revision in the
hypersonic flight plan. His job tonight was to make sure all the surprises were
his, not somebody else's. There wouldn't be any margin for screw-ups.
Everything had to go like clockwork.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He edged his way on through the freezing bay, searching the
banks of equipment for a clue, and then he saw what he was looking for. There,
along the portside bulkhead. It was a white, rectangular console, and
everything about it told him immediately it was what he wanted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He studied it a second, trying to decide where to begin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment he also caught himself wondering fleetingly
how he'd ever gotten into this crazy situation. Maybe he should have quit the
Air Force years ago and gone to engineering school like his father had wanted.
Right now, he had to admit, a little electrical engineering would definitely
come in handy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He took out a pocket screwdriver and began carefully removing
the AI console's faceplate, a bronzed rectangle. Eight screws later, he lifted
it off and settled it on the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The penlight revealed a line of chips connected by neat
sections of plastic-coated wires. Somewhere in this electronic ganglia there
had to be a crucial node where he could attach the device he'd brought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It had taken some doing, but he'd managed to assemble an item
that should take care of his problem beautifully when the moment came. It was a
radio-controlled, electrically operated blade that, when clamped onto a strand
of wires, could sever them in an instant. The radio range was fifty meters,
which would be adequate; the transmitter, no larger than a small tape recorder,
was going to be with him in his flight suit. The instant he switched the
turboramjets over to the scramjet mode, he was going to activate it and blow
their fucking AI module out of the system. Permanently.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He figured he had ten minutes before one of the security team
came looking to see what he was doing; he'd timed this moment to coincide with
their regular tea break. Even the Japanese didn't work around the clock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now, holding the penlight and shivering from the cold, he
began carefully checking the wires. Carefully, so very carefully. He didn't
have a diagram of their computer linkages, and he had to make sure he didn't
accidentally interrupt the main power source, since the one thing he didn't
want to do was disconnect any of the other flight control systems. He wanted to
cut in somewhere between the AI module's power supply and its central
processor. The power source led in here . . . and then up the side over to
there, a high-voltage transformer . . . and then out from . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There. Just after the step-up transformer and before the
motherboard with the dedicated CPU and I/O. That should avoid any shorting in
the main power system and keep the interruption nice and localized.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The line was almost half an inch thick, double-stranded,
copper grounded with a coaxial sheath. But there was a clear section that led
directly down to the CPU. That's where he'd place the blade, and hope it'd at
least short- circuit the power feed even if it didn't sever the wires
completely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He tested the radio transmitter one last time, making sure it
would activate the blade, then reached down and clamped the mechanism onto the
wire, tightening it with thumb screws. When it was as secure as he could make
it, he stood back and examined his handiwork. If somebody decided to remove the
faceplate, they'd spot it in a second, but otherwise . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Quickly, hands trembling from the cold, he fitted the cover
back on the module and began replacing the screws with the tiny screwdriver. It
wasn't magnetized, a deliberate choice, so the small screws kept slipping
between his bulky fingers, a problem made more acute by the numbing cold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Three screws to go . . . then he heard the noise. Footsteps
on the aluminum catwalk in the pressure bay above. . . . <i>Shit</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He kept working as fast as he could, grimly holding
the screws secure and fighting back the numbness and pain in his freezing
fingers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Only one more. Above, he could hear the sounds of someone
checking each of the equipment bays, methodically opening and then resecuring
them. First the starboard side bay was opened and closed, then the portside
bay. Now he heard footsteps advancing down the metal stairs leading to the
computer bay. They were five seconds away from discovering him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The last screw was in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He tried to stand, and realized his knees were numb. He
staggered backward, grabbing for something to steady himself . . . and the
light came on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yuri Andreevich, so this is where you are. What are you
doing here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was the gravel voice of his father. He felt like a child
again, caught with his hand in his pants. What should he do? tell the truth?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm—I'm checking over the consoles, passing the time. I
couldn't sleep.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't lie to me.&quot; Andrei Androv's ancient eyebrows
gathered into the skeptical furrow Yuri knew so well. &quot;You're up to
something, another of your tricks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yuri stared at him a moment. How had he known? A sixth sense?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Moi otyets</i>, why are you here? You should be
getting your sleep.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm an old man. An old man worries. I had a feeling you
might be in here tonight, tinkering with the vehicle. You told me you were
planning something. I think the time has come to tell me what it is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yuri took a deep breath and looked him over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No, it was too risky. For them both. His secret had to be
ironclad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's better if you don't know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you wish,&quot; the old man sighed. &quot;But if you
do something foolish . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I damned sure intend to try.&quot; He met his father's
steely gaze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So did you do it?&quot; Andrei Androv examined him, his
ancient face ashen beneath his mane of white hair. &quot;Did you manage to
sabotage the AI module?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He caught himself laughing out loud. Whatever else, his
father was no fool. He'd been a Russian too long to believe anything he heard
or half of what he saw. Intrigue was a way of life for him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let's go. They'll come looking for us soon. This is the
wrong place to be found.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Go back to the West Quadrant. Listen to a string quartet.&quot;
He opened the port and waited for his father to step out. Then he followed,
closing it behind them. &quot;There's no reason for you to be involved. Heads
are going to roll, but why should yours be one of them?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Andrei Petrovich Androv moved lightly up the metal stair, the
spring in his step belying his age. At the top he paused and turned back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're acting out of principle, aren't you, Yuri? For
once in your life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I guess you could say that.&quot; He smiled, then moved
on up the steps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Someday, the Russian people will thank you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Someday. Though I may not live to see it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Andrei Androv stopped, his ancient eyes tearing as his voice
dropped to a whisper. &quot;Of all the things you've ever done, my son, nothing
could make me more proud of you than what you just said. I've thought it over,
about the military uses for this vehicle, and I think the future of the world
is about to be rewritten here. You must stop them. You're the only chance we
have left.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The limousine had already left the Savoy and was headed down
the Strand when Alex Novosty broke the silence. He leaned forward, pushed the
button on the two-way microphone linking the passenger compartment to the
driver, and spoke in Russian.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Igor Borisovich, there's been an alteration in our
plans. We will not be going to Westminster Union. Take us to Moscow Narodny
Bank. The trading branch on Saint Swithins Lane.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Shto ve skazale</i>?&quot; Igor, still nursing his
head from the kidnapping, glanced into his rearview mirror. &quot;The bank's
main office is on King William Street. We always—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just do as you're told.&quot; Novosty cut him off, then
killed the mike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vera Karanova stared at him, her dark eyes flooding with
concern. &quot;But you said the transaction was scheduled for Westminster Union
Bank, this morning at ten-thirty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That was merely a diversion.&quot; Novosty leaned back.
&quot;The actual arrangement is turned around. For security reasons.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't like this.&quot; Her displeasure was obvious,
and mounting. &quot;There is no reason—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's better, I assure you.&quot; He withdrew a white
tin of Balkan Sobranie cigarettes from his coat, snapped it open, and withdrew
one. Made of fine Turkish Yenidje tobacco, they were what he always smoked on
important days. This was an important day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he flicked his lighter and drew in the first lungful of
rich smoke, he thought about how much he hated the dark-haired woman seated
beside him, dressed in a gray Armani business suit, sable coat, Cartier
jewelry. The bad blood between them traced back over five years, beginning with
a T-Directorate reshuffle in which she'd moved up to the number three slot,
cutting him out of a well-deserved promotion. The rumor going around
Dzerzhinsky Square was that she'd done it by making the right connections, so
to speak. It was the kind of in-house screw- job Alex Novosty didn't soon
forget, of forgive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Their black limo was now passing the Royal Courts of Justice,
on the left, headed onto Fleet Street. Ahead was Cannon Street, which
intersected the end of Saint Swithins Lane. Just a few blocks more. After
today, he fully intended never to see her again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We've arranged for the transaction to take place
through MNB's bond trading desk,&quot; Novosty continued, almost as though to
nobody in particular. &quot;Michael and I have taken care of everything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who approved this change?&quot; She angrily gripped the
handrest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I did,&quot; Novosty replied sharply. &quot;We're in
charge.&quot; He masked a smile, pleased to see her upset. The morning traffic
was now almost at a standstill, but they would be on time. &quot;After all, he
still has the money.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And for all you know he may be in Brazil by now.
Perhaps that's the reason he and the woman disappeared last night, with the
help of an accomplice who assaulted Igor Borisovich.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael will be there,&quot; Novosty said. &quot;Have
no fear. He's not going anywhere till this is finished.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;After this is completed,&quot; she said matter-of-factly,
&quot;he will be finished. I hope you have planned for that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Novosty glanced over, wondering what she meant. Had all the
surprises been covered? He hoped so, because this deal was his gateway to
freedom. The two million commission would mean a new beginning for him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

the phone to ring. How would Michael play it? Admittedly it was smart to keep
everything close to the chest, but still. He would have felt better if Michael
Vance, Jr., had favored him with a little more trust.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the other hand, keeping the details of the operation under
wraps as long as possible was probably wise. It minimized the chance for some
inadvertent slip-up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, it was definitely best. Because he was staring across
his desk at four of Tanzan Mino's Tokyo <i>kobun</i>, all dressed in shiny
black leather jackets. They'd arrived at the Docklands office just after dawn,
announcing they were there to hand-deliver the money to Tokyo. Jiro Sato had
directed them to Westminster Union.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The four all carried black briefcases, which did not contain
business papers. They intended to accomplish their mission by whatever means
necessary. Jiro Sato, the London <i>oyabun</i>, had not been invited to send
his people along with them this morning. He was now humiliated and disgraced,
officially removed from the operation, on Tokyo's orders. The regional office
had failed, so Tokyo had sent in a <i>Mino-gumi</i> version of the Delta Force.
They clearly had orders concerning what to do with Michael Vance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He didn't like this new twist. For everything to go according
to plan, violence had to be kept out of it. There was no way he and Michael
could go head to head with street enforcers. If Michael was thinking of doing
that, the man was crazy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He glanced at his gold Omega, noting that it read ten-
nineteen. In eleven more minutes he'd know how Michael intended to run the
scenario.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But whatever happened, he wasn't going to be intimidated by
these <i>kobun</i> hoods, dark sunglasses and automatics notwithstanding. Those
days were over. Michael had given him a perfect opportunity to start building a
new life. He didn't care if all hell was about to break loose.</span></p>

color:windowtext'>He was feeling nervous, which was unusual and he didn't like
it. Whenever he got that way, things always started going off the track.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They were now in the paneled elevator, heading up to the
sixth floor of the Moscow Narodny Bank. The hundred million had been held
overnight in the vault of Victoria Courier Service Limited, which was scheduled
to deliver the satchels this morning at ten-thirty sharp. The location for the
delivery, however, was known only to him and to Michael Vance. He wanted to be
sure and arrive there ahead of the money. He also would have much preferred
being without the company of Vera Karanova.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One thing you had to say for Michael: He'd arranged the deal
with great finesse. He didn't trust anybody. Until he notified Victoria Courier
this morning, nobody knew where the money would be taken, not even the Japanese
banker Nogami. Still, the instruments were negotiable, leaving the possibility
of trouble if the timing went sour.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He intended to make sure it didn't. The planning had been
split-second up until now; this was no moment to relax his guard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, it was good he was here. As he studied Comrade Karanova,
he realized that something about her was still making him uneasy. So far it was
merely a hunch, but his hunches had been right more often than he liked to
think.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He tried to push the feeling aside. Probably just paranoia.
She obviously was here today for the same reason he was, to make sure the
Soviet money was returned safely. She probably was also still worried about the
protocol, but that problem was hers, not his. From today on, the KGB would have
to work out their in-fighting back home the best way they could. The ground
rules were changing fast in Moscow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Besides, Dzerzhinsky Square was about to become part of a
previous life for him. If he could just clear this up, get his commission, he'd
be set. Forever. Enough was enough. Maybe he'd end up in the Caribbean like
Michael, drinking margaritas and counting string bikinis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The elevator door opened. Facing them were Michael Vance and
Eva Borodin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Glad you could make it.&quot; Vance glanced coldly at
Vera. &quot;Right on time. The money arrives in exactly seven minutes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She nodded a silent greeting, pulling her sable coat tighter
as she strode past. The bank officials lined up along the corridor watched her
with nervous awe. Even in London, T-Directorate brass had clout.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They moved as a group down the long carpeted hallway leading
to the counting room. On this floor everything was high-security, with
uniformed guards at all the doorways. Negotiable instruments weren't handled
casually.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=bookmark64><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>An armoured van with V.C.S., Ltd. lettered on its side pulled
up to the black marble front of Moscow Narodny Bank's financial trading branch
on Saint Swithins Lane. Everything was on schedule.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They're here.&quot; Eva was watching from the narrow
window. Saint Swithins Lane down below, virtually an alley, was so narrow it
could accommodate only one vehicle at a time. Across was Banque Worms, its
unicorn insignia staring out, its lobby chandeliers glowing. Nobody there even
bothered to notice. Just another armored truck interrupting the view.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then three blue-uniformed guards emerged from the cab and
approached the rear doors from both sides, .38's in unsnapped holsters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Vance, they had better have the money, all of
it.&quot; Vera stepped over to the window and followed Eva's gaze down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It'll be there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;For your sake I hope so,&quot; she replied as she
turned back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just hang around and watch,&quot; Vance said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just one more day, he told himself. One more lousy day. We'll
have enough of the protocol translated by tomorrow, the press package ready.
Then we drop it on the papers and blow town.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>From the hallway outside a bell chimed faintly as the
elevator opened, a private lift that came directly up from the lobby. When he
heard the heavy footsteps of the couriers, accompanied by MNB guards, he
stepped over and quickly glanced out. The two blue-suits were each carrying a
large satchel handcuffed to the left wrist. Obviously the third had stayed
downstairs, guarding the van.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This way.&quot; The heavy-jowled director of the MNB
bond trading desk stepped out and motioned them in. The play was on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kenji Nogami's issue of Mino Industries debentures had been
registered with the Issuing House Association the previous day. This morning
they would be acquired by Vance, using a wire transfer between the Moscow
Narodny Bank on Saint Swithins Lane and Westminster Union Bank's bond desk.
After that there would be a second transaction, whereby Sumitomo Bank, Limited
would accept the debentures as security for a loan of one hundred million
dollars, to be wire-transferred back to Westminster Union and from there to
Moscow Narodny Bank. Everything had been prearranged. The whole transaction
would require only minutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Unless there was a glitch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance had fully expected that Tanzan Mino would send a
welcoming committee to Nogami's premises, which was why he'd arranged for the
money to be delivered here at Moscow Narodny's side-street branch. He figured
the Soviets, at least, would play it straight. KGB wanted its file closed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then too, Eva still had the protocol. Their back-up insurance
policy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Vance.&quot; Vera Karanova watched as the two
security men unlatched their satchels and began withdrawing the bundles of open
cashiers checks and bearer bonds. &quot;I want to recount these securities,
now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There're double-counted tallys already
prepared&quot;—he pointed toward the bundles—&quot;yesterday by the main branch
of Moscow Narodny. The printouts are attached.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That was their count,&quot; she replied. &quot;I intend
to make my own, before we go any further.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which means time lost, he thought. Doesn't she realize we've
got to get this cash recycled, those bonds purchased and in place, before
Tanzan Mino's <i>kobun </i>have a chance to move on us? If the deal to acquire
Ken's new Mino Industries debentures doesn't go through, giving us something to
hold over the godfather's head . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She's literally playing into his hands.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The instruments are all here, all negotiable, and all
ready to go,&quot; he said, stealing a quick glance toward Eva. One look at her
eyes told him she also sensed trouble brewing. &quot;Now, we're damn well going
to move and move fast. We credit the funds here, then wire them to Westminster
Union. And by God we do it immediately.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Vance, you are no longer giving the orders,&quot;
she replied sharply. &quot;I'm in charge here now. As a matter of fact, I have
no intention of wiring the money anywhere. There will be no purchase of debentures.
As far as I'm concerned, it has now been returned.&quot; She paused for
emphasis. &quot;But first we will count it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Vera, my love,&quot; Eva said, cutting her off,
&quot;if you try and double-cross us, you're making a very big mistake. You
seem to forget we've got that protocol. What we didn't get around to telling
you is that we've deciphered it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's right. As it happens, I don't think you're going
to like what it's got to say, but you might at least want to know the story
before you read about it in The Times day after tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alex Novosty's face had turned ashen. &quot;Michael, Tanzan
Mino's people are probably headed here by now. Unless they go to the main
office on King William Street first.&quot; He was nervously glancing out the
window. &quot;We're running out of time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The game's about to get rough, Vance thought. Better take
charge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But before he could move, Novosty was gripping a Ruger P-85,
a lightweight 9mm automatic, pulled from a holster under the back of his
jacket. He'd worn it where the MNB guards would miss it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The two Victoria couriers were caught flat-footed. Bankers
weren't supposed to start drawing weapons. They stared in astonishment as he
gestured for them to turn and face the wall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael,&quot; he said as he glanced over, &quot;would
you kindly give me a hand and take those two .38's? We really must get this
party moving.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vera Karanova was smiling a thin smile. &quot;I don't know
how far you think you will get with this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We seem to be working toward different
objectives,&quot; Novosty answered. &quot;Michael has a solution to everybody's
problem. I regret very much you've chosen not to help facilitate it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The only problem he solved was yours,&quot; she shot
back. &quot;Mr. Vance devised what amounts to an enormous check kiting scheme.
You two planned to perpetrate fraud. You're nothing better than criminals, both
of you, and I intend to make sure you haven't also given us a short
count.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Comrade, fraud is a harsh word,&quot; Vance
interjected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You are not as amusing as you think,&quot; she replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Humor makes the world go round.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>'This is not a joke. The negotiable instruments in this room
are Soviet funds. I intend to make sure those funds are intact. There will be a
full and complete count. Now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She's gone over the edge, he told himself. She's definitely
going to try and screw us, either wittingly or unwittingly. But who in the room
is going to help her? That huddled group of Russian bankers now staring
terrified at Novosty's 9mm? Not damned likely. She's improvising, on her own.
But her little stunt could well end up sinking the ship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The two couriers were now spread against the brown textured
fabric of the wall, legs apart. He walked over and reached into the leather
holsters at their hips, drawing out their revolvers. They were snub-nosed Smith
&amp; Wesson Bodyguards, .38 caliber. He looked them over, cocked them, and
handed one to Eva.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How about covering the door? I think it's time we got
down to business and traded some bonds.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;With pleasure.&quot; She stepped over and glanced out.
It was clear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you think, Alex?&quot; Vance turned back.
&quot;Word's going around there's a hot new issue of Mino Industries
zero-coupons coming out today. What do you say we go long? In for a hundred.
Just take the lot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I heard the same rumor, this very morning,&quot; he
smiled. &quot;You're right. My instincts say it's a definite buy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Fine.&quot; Vance turned to MNB's jowled branch chief.
&quot;We'd like to do a little trading here this morning. Mind getting the bond
desk at Westminster Union on the line? Tell Nogami we're good for a hundred in
Mino Industries debentures, the new issue. At par.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael.&quot; It was Eva's voice, suddenly alarmed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We've got company. They look like field reps.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good God.&quot; Novosty strode to the door and looked
out. A group of four leather-jacketed Japanese were headed down the hallway,
two disarmed MNB guards in front. Also with them was Kenji Nogami.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Turning back, he looked imploringly at Vance. &quot;What do
we do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Figure they came prepared.&quot; He waved toward Eva.
&quot;Better lose that .38. Put it on the table for now. Maybe we can still
talk this thing through.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She nodded, then stepped over and laid her weapon beside the
bundles of securities. Vance took one last look at the Smith &amp; Wesson in
his own hand and did the same. Even ex-archaeologists could do arithmetic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All this time Vera Karanova had said nothing. She merely
stood watching the proceedings with a detached smile. Finally she spoke.
&quot;Now we can proceed with the counting,&quot; she said calmly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe you don't fully grasp the situation here, comrade.&quot;
Vance stared at her. &quot;Those gorillas aren't dropping in for tea. We've got
to stand together.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She burst out laughing. &quot;Mr. Vance, you are truly naive.
No, you're worse. You actually thought you could sabotage the most powerful new
global alliance of the twentieth century.&quot; Her dark eyes were gradually
turning glacial. &quot;It will not be allowed to happen, believe me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God, he realized, that's why she wanted to get her hands
on the protocol. To deep-six it. She's been biding her time, stringing us
along. And today she managed to stall us long enough for Mino's boys to figure
out the switch. She's no longer working for T-Directorate; she's part of Tanzan
Mino's operation. All this time she's been working with them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The negotiable certificates in this room will be delivered
to their rightful recipient by his personal jet,&quot; she continued.
&quot;Today.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Over my dead body.&quot; He found himself thinking it
might well be true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, Mr. Vance, not exactly. Your contribution will be
more substantial than that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was speechless, for the first time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Russian bankers in the room were taken totally by
surprise. Double-dealing KGB games had always been part of the landscape, but
this was confusing in the extreme. Whose money was it anyway?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael.&quot; Novosty's voice was trembling.
&quot;This cannot be allowed to happen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I agree. We've definitely got a situation here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He glanced around to see the four <i>Mino-gumi kobun </i>poised
in the doorway, all with H&amp;K automatics now out of their briefcases. Kenji
Nogami was standing behind them, his eyes defeated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Novosty still looked stunned. The range of options was
rapidly narrowing to none.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vera indicated his Ruger. &quot;You would be wise to put that
away. Now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If they take these securities, my life's not worth a <i>kopeck</i>.&quot;
Novosty seemed to be thinking out loud. &quot;What does it matter.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It wasn't a question. It was a statement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Remembering it all later, Vance could barely recall the
precise sequence of events. He did remember shoving Eva back against the wall
as the fireworks began.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Novosty's first round caught the lead <i>Mino-gumi kobun</i>
squarely between the eyes. As he pitched backward, arms flailing, he tumbled
against the others, giving Novosty time to fire again. With deadly accuracy he
caught another in the chest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kenji Nogami had already thrown himself on the thick hallway
carpet, safely avoiding the fusillade. The Russian bankers, too, had all hit
the floor, along with the MNB guards and the two couriers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then came a shot with a different sound—the dull thunk of a
silencer. Novosty jerked in surprise, pain spreading through his eyes. The
silencer thunked again, and again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was Vera Karanova. She was holding a small .22 caliber
Walther PP, with a specially equipped silencer. And her aim was flawless.
Novosty had three slugs arranged neatly down the side of his head before he
even realized what was happening. He collapsed forward, never knowing whose
hand had been on the gun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She's probably wanted to get rid of him for years, Vance
thought fleetingly. She finally got her golden opportunity, the double-crossing
bitch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He briefly considered grabbing back one of the .38's and
avenging Alex then and there, but he knew it would be suicidal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alex, no!&quot; Eva's voice sobbed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Both of you, hands on the wall.&quot; Comrade Karanova
was definitely in charge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael,&quot; Eva said, turning to comply, &quot;what
happened to our well-laid plans?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Looks like too little, too late.&quot; He stretched
beside her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What did she mean just now? About our 'contribution'?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Probably the protocol. My guess is she wants to see it
destroyed. Let's hope that'll be the end of it. The godfather's got his money.
And Alex's problem is solved permanently.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Kenji Nogami was entering the room, an island of Zen-like
calm amidst all the bedlam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, I'm so sorry.&quot; He stepped over.
&quot;When the money didn't show up as scheduled, they called Jiro Sato and he
suggested they try here. There was nothing I could do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance nodded. &quot;That's how I figured it'd be played. We
didn't move fast enough on this end. It was my fault.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Too bad. We came close.&quot; He sighed. &quot;But I'm
not going to underwrite the rest of those bogus debentures. He'll have to kill
me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And he'll probably do just that. The hell with it. You
tried, we all tried. Now it looks like Tanzan Mino's scam is going to go
through whether we play or not. You might as well save your own skin. With any
luck, we can still sort out our end, but you—you're going to have to be dealing
with that bastard for years to come. Think about it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm still deciding,&quot; he said finally. &quot;Let's
wait and see how things go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alex opted for suicide. You shouldn't follow his
lead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not suicidal.&quot; He stepped back as Vera
proceeded to pat them down. &quot;I think very carefully about my options.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Get the money.&quot; She was directing the two
remaining <i>Mino-gumi kobun </i>toward the table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Gonna just rob the bank now, Comrade?&quot; Vance
turned and looked at her, then at the three bodies strewn on the floor. The <i>kobun
</i>seemed to consider their late colleagues merely casualties of war. The dead
men received almost no notice. &quot;Pretty costly little enterprise, wouldn't
you say. Not a very propitious start for your new era of world serenity.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You would be advised to shut up,&quot; she responded
sharply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I feel personally violated by all this.&quot; Nogami
had turned to her and his voice was like steel. &quot;As of this moment, you
can put out of your mind any illusion I might cooperate further. This outrage
is beyond acceptability.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We did what had to be done,&quot; Vera said. &quot;We
still expect your cooperation and I do not think we will be disappointed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then your expectation is sadly misplaced,&quot; he
replied icily. His eyes signified he meant every word.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We will see.&quot; She dismissed him as she turned her
attention to the money. The two <i>kobun</i> had carefully removed their shiny
black leather jackets now and laid them on the table. Underneath they wore
tightly tailored white shirts, complete with underarm holsters containing 9mm
Llamas. The automatics were back in their briefcases, positioned by the door.
Stripped down for action, they were quickly and professionally tallying the
certificates, one handling the open cashiers checks and the other the bearer
bonds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Guess they intend to keep a close eye on the details, Vance
thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, screw them. We've still got the protocol. We've got
some leverage left.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But he was having trouble focusing on the future. He was
still in shock from the sight of Novosty being gunned down in cold blood.
Alex's abrupt death was a tragic end to an exceptional, if sometimes dubious,
career. He'd really wanted Novosty to make this one last score. The man deserved
it. He was an operator who lived at the edge, and Vance had always admired
players who put everything on the table, no matter which side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, he told himself, the scenario had come close, damned
close. But maybe it was doomed from the start. You only get so many chances to
tempt the fates. Today everybody's number came up, Alex's for the last time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Rest in peace, Aleksei Ilyich.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Vera turned back to them. &quot;Now, I want the computer.
We know it was moved to the house in Kensington, but our search this morning
did not locate it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So they were on to us from the start, Vance realized.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Looks like you've got a problem.&quot; He strolled over
and plopped down in one of the straight-backed chairs along the opposite wall.
&quot;Too bad.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, you have a problem.&quot; She examined him confidently.
&quot;Because if those materials are not returned to us, we will be forced to
take actions you may find harsh.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Give it your best shot,&quot; he went on, glancing at
Eva and hoping they could keep up the bravado, &quot;because we've got a few
cards in our hand too. Forget the money—that's history now—but we could still
be in a position to blow your whole project sky high.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You two are the only ones outside our organization who
know about the protocol. That knowledge will not be allowed to go any
farther.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't be so sure. For all you know, we've already
stashed a copy somewhere. Left word that if anything happens to either one of
us, the package gets sent to the papers. Made public. Think what some premature
headlines would do for your little project.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We have thought about it, Mr. Vance. That contingency
has been covered.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, if I don't know what the other player's got, I
tend to trust my own cards.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But why play at all? he suddenly found himself musing. Fold
this hand and go for the next move.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before leaving Crete he'd transmitted a copy of the protocol,
still in its encrypted form, to his office computer in Nassau. At the time it'd
merely seemed like prudence; now it might turn out to be a lifeline. One phone
call and it could be transmitted back here this very afternoon. The magic of
satellites in space. Knock out another quick translation and they'd only have
lost one day. What the hell. Use that as a fallback position. Time, that's all
it would take, just a little more time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But what does it matter? The game's up anyway.&quot; He
nodded toward Vera, then turned to Eva, sending her a pointed signal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What was it Shakespeare said about discretion and
valor,&quot; she concurred, understanding exactly what he was thinking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The man knew when to fish and when to cut bait.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;True enough. Shall you tell them or shall I?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You can do the honors.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She walked over and picked up her briefcase. &quot;You didn't
really think we'd leave it, did you, Comrade? So just take it and good
riddance. A little gift from the NSA. Who says America's getting stingy with
its foreign aid?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Comrade Karanova motioned for the two <i>kobun </i>to take
the case. &quot;See if it's there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they moved to comply, Vance found himself wondering if
this really was going to turn off the heat. Somehow it no longer seemed
adequate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Hai so</i>,&quot; he grunted through his teeth as he
lifted it, &quot;something is here.&quot; Vance noticed that two digits of the
little finger on his left hand were missing, along with another digit on his
ring finger. Good thing Ken was never a street man, he thought fleetingly.
Guess bankers get to pay for their mistakes with something besides sections of
finger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then take it out,&quot; Vera commanded. &quot;We are
running out of time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>You've got that right, lady, Vance thought. Three men were
just killed. That personal Boeing of Tanzan Mino's better be warming up its
Pratt &amp; Whitney's right now. London's about to get too hot for you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One of the <i>kobun  </i>withdrew the Zenith. He placed it on
the mahogany table, then unlatched the top and lifted it up, only to stare at
the blank gray screen, unsure what he was supposed to do next.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vera knew. She reached for the switch on the side and clicked
it on, then stood back and turned to Eva.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Call up the file. I want to see if you have really broken
the encryption, the way you said.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Truth time,&quot; she laughed, then punched up the
translation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Project Daedalus</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>And there it was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Comrade Karanova studied it a moment, as though not quite
believing her eyes. But she plainly had seen it before. &quot;Congratulations.
We were sure no one would be able to break the encryption, not even you.&quot;
She glanced around. &quot;You are very clever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay,&quot; Vance interjected, &quot;I'm sure we all
have better things to do this morning. So why don't you take the damned thing
and get out of here. It's what you wanted. Just go and we'll all try and forget
any of this ever happened.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She flipped down the computer's screen, then turned back.
&quot;Unfortunately nothing is ever that simple. I'm sorry to have to tell you
two that we haven't seen the last of each other.&quot; She paused, then
continued. &quot;In fact, we are about to become much better acquainted.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You once told me, back when we met on the plane from
Athens, you would welcome that. You should be happy that your wish is now about
to be granted. You both are going to be our guests.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's kind of you.&quot; He stared at her, startled.
&quot;But we can probably bear up to the separation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, I must insist. You were right about the
difficulties. Your death now would be awkward, for a number of reasons. Alex
will be trouble enough to explain, but that is purely an internal Soviet
matter. Moscow Narodny can cover it. However, eliminating you two would raise
awkward inquiries. On the other hand, you represent a security risk to the
project. Consequently we have no option. Surely you understand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He understood all too well. This was the one turn he hadn't
figured on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Almost eight years. It had been that long ago. But what had
Ken said? The Tokyo <i>oyabun </i>never forgot. What this really meant was that
Tanzan Mino wanted to settle the score first hand. What did he have planned?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance had a sudden feeling he didn't want to know. It was
going to be a zero-sum game. Everything on the table and winner take all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Uzi. The goddam Uzi. Why hadn't they brought it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was still back in Kensington, where they'd stashed it in
the false bottom of a new suitcase. But if the <i>Mino-gumi</i> had been
searching only for a computer, maybe they'd missed it. So Tanzan Mino's hoods
could still be in for a surprise. Just make an excuse to go back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vera was aware an Uzi had been part of their deal for the
limo, but maybe that fact had momentarily slipped her mind, what with all the
important things she had to think about. Or maybe she'd assumed Alex had kept it,
or maybe she thought it was still in the car. Whatever she thought, things were
moving too fast now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I get the picture,&quot; he said, rising from his
chair. With a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>carefully
feigned nonchalance, he strolled over to the table. &quot;Guess it's time we
got our toothbrushes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You won't have to bother, Mr. Vance,&quot; Vera
continued. &quot;Your suitcases were sent to the plane an hour ago. We found
them conveniently packed. Don't worry. Everything has already been taken care
of.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, scratch the Uzi. Looks like it's now or never. Settle
it here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He shot a glance at Eva, then at Ken, trying to signal them.
They caught it, and they knew. She began strolling in the direction of Vera,
who was now standing in the doorway, as though readying to depart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We appreciate the snappy service,&quot; Vance said. He
looked down at the computer, then bent over. When he came up, it was in his
right hand, sailing in an arc. He brought it around with all his might, aimed
for the nearest Japanese <i>kobun</i>. He was on target, catching the man
squarely in the stomach.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With a startled, disbelieving look the Japanese stumbled
backward, crashing over a large chair positioned next to the table. The other <i>kobun</i>
instantly reached for his holstered Llama, but by then Kenji Nogami had moved,
seizing him and momentarily pinning his arms with a powerful embrace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For her own part, Eva had lunged for Vera and her purse, to
neutralize the Walther she carried. Comrade Karanova, however, had already
anticipated everything. She whisked back the purse, then plunged her hand in.
What she withdrew, though, was not a pistol but a shiny cylindrical object made
of glass.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was three against three, a snapshot of desperation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We've got a chance, Vance thought. Keep him down. And get the
Llama.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the <i>kobun</i> tried to rise, gasping, Vance threw
himself over the upturned chair, reaching to pin the man's arms. With a
bear-like embrace he had him, the body small and muscular in his arms. Out of
the corner of his eye he saw Kenji Nogami still grappling with the other <i>kobun</i>.
The computer now lay on the floor, open and askew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Where's Eva? He tried to turn and look for her, but there was
no sound to guide him. Then the <i>kobun</i> wrenched free one arm and brought
a fist against the side of his face, diverting him back to matters at hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hold him down. Just get the gun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He tried to crush his larger frame against the other's slim
body, forcing the air out of him. Focus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But the wiry man was stronger than he looked. With a twist he
rolled over and pinned Vance's shoulders against the carpet. Vance felt the
shag, soft against his skin, and couldn't believe how chilly it felt. But now
he had his hand on the <i>kobun’s</i> throat, holding him in a powerful grip
while jamming a free elbow against the holster.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Cut off his oxygen. Don't let him breathe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The old moves were coming back, the shortcuts that would
bring a more powerful opponent to submission. He pressed a thumb against the
man's windpipe, shutting off his air. A look of surprise went through the <i>kobun's</i>
eyes as he choked, letting his hold on Vance's shoulders slacken.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He shoved the man's arm aside and reached for the holster.
Then his hand closed around the hard grip of the Llama. The Japanese was weaker
now, but still forcing his arm away from the gun, preventing him from getting
the grip he needed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He rammed an elbow against the man's chin, then tightened his
finger on the grip of the Llama. He almost had it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With his other hand he shoved the <i>kobun</i>'s face away,
clawing at his eyes, and again they rolled over, with the Japanese once more
against the carpet. But now he had the gun and he was turning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He felt a sharp jab in his back, a flash of pain that seemed
to come from nowhere. It was both intense and numbing, as though his spine had
been caught in a vise. Then he felt his heart constrict, his orientation spin.
He rolled to the side, flailing an arm to try and recover his balance, but the
room was in rotation, his vision playing tricks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The one thing he did see was Vera Karanova standing over him,
a blurred image his mind tried vainly to correct. Her face was faltering, the
indistinct outlines of a desert mirage. Was she real or was he merely dreaming?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. . . Now the room was growing serene, a slow-motion
phantasmagoria of pastel colors and soft, muted sounds. He tried to reach out,
but there was nothing. Instead he heard faint music, dulcet beckoning tones.
The world had entered another dimension, a seamless void. He wanted to be part
of its emptiness, to swathe himself in the cascade of oblivion lifting him up.
A perfect repose was drifting through him, a wave of darkness. He heard his own
breathing as he was buoyed into a blood-red mist. He was floating, on a journey
he had long waited to take, to a place far, far away. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The hypersonic test flight must proceed as
scheduled,&quot; Tanzan Mino said quietly. &quot;Now that all the financial arrangements
have been completed, the Coordinating Committee of the LDP has agreed to bring
the treaty before the Diet next week. A delay is unthinkable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The problem is not technical, Mino-sama,&quot; Taro
Ikeda, the project director, continued, his tone ripe with deference. &quot;It
is the Soviet pilot. Perhaps he should be replaced.&quot; He looked down,
searching for the right words. &quot;I'm concerned. I think he has discovered
the stealth capabilities of the vehicle. Probably accidentally, but all the
same, I'm convinced he is now aware of them. Two nights ago he engaged in
certain unauthorized maneuvers I believe were intended to verify those
capabilities.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>So deshoo</i>.&quot; Tanzan Mino's eyes narrowed.
&quot;But he has said nothing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No. Not a word. At least to me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then perhaps he was merely behaving erratically. It
would not be the first time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The maneuvers. They were too explicit,&quot; Ikeda
continued. &quot;As I said, two nights ago, on the last test fight, he switched
off the transponder, then performed a snap roll and took the vehicle into a
power dive, all the way to the deck. It was intended to be a radar-evasive
action.&quot; The project director allowed himself a faint, ironic smile.
&quot;At least we now know that the technology works. The vehicle's radar
signature immediately disappeared off the tracking monitors at Katsura.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It met the specifications?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ikeda nodded. &quot;Yesterday I ordered a computer analysis
of the data tapes. The preliminary report suggests it may even have exceeded
them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tanzan Mino listened in silence. He was sitting at his desk
in the command sector wing of the North Quadrant at the Hokkaido facility.
Although the sector was underground, like the rest of the facility, behind his
desk was a twenty-foot-long &quot;window&quot; with periscope double mirrors
that showed the churning breakers of La Perouse Strait.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His jet had touched down on the facility's runway at 6:48
A.M. and been promptly towed into the hangar. Tanzan Mino intended to be in
personal command when <i>Daedalus I</i> went hypersonic, in just nineteen
hours. The video monitors in his office were hard-wired directly to the main
console in Flight Control, replicating its data displays, and all decisions
passed across his desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Leave the pilot to me,&quot; he said without emotion,
revolving to gaze out the wide window, which displayed the mid-afternoon sun
catching the crests of whitecaps far at sea. &quot;What he knows or doesn't
know will not disrupt the schedule.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Once again, he thought, I've got to handle a problem
personally. Why? Because nobody else here has the determination to make the
scenario succeed. First the protocol, and then the money. I had to intervene to
resolve both.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But, he reflected with a smile, it turned out that handling
those difficulties personally had produced an unexpected dividend.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As you say, <i>Mino-sama</i>,&quot; Ikeda bowed.
&quot;I merely wanted to make you aware of my concern about the pilot. He
should be monitored more closely from now on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Which is precisely what I intend to do.&quot; Tanzan
Mino's silver hair seemed to blend with the sea beyond. &quot;There is an
obvious solution. When he takes the vehicle hypersonic, he will not be
alone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you suggesting? No one else—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Merely a simple security precaution. If he is not reliable,
then steps must be taken. Two of our people will be in the cockpit with
him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean the scientists from Tsukuba? The cockpit was
designed to accommodate a three-man crew, but MITI hasn't yet designated the
two researchers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No. I mean my personal pilot and copilot. From the
Boeing. Then if Androv deviates from the prescribed test program in any way,
they will be there, ready to take immediate action. The problem is
solved.&quot; He revolved back from the window. &quot;That will be all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ikeda bowed, then turned and hurriedly made his way toward
the door. He didn't like last-minute improvisations, but the CEO was now fully
in command. Preparations for two additional life-support systems would have to
be started immediately.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After Tanzan Mino watched him depart, he reached down and
activated a line of personal video monitors beside his desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance recognized the sound immediately. It was the harp-like
plucking of a Japanese <i>koto</i>, punctuated by the tinkling of a wind chime.
Without opening his eyes, he reached out and touched a hard, textured surface.
It was, he realized, a straw mat, and from the firmness of the weave he knew it
was <i>tatami</i>. Then he felt the soft cotton of the padded mat beneath him
and guessed he was lying on a futon. The air in the room was faintly spiced
with Mahayana Buddhist temple incense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'm in Japan, he told himself. Or somebody wants me to think
I am.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He opened his eyes and found himself looking at a rice-paper
lamp on the floor next to his futon. Directly behind it, on the left, was a <i>tokonoma
</i>art alcove, built next to a set of sliding doors. A small, round <i>shoji</i>
window in the <i>tokonoma  </i>shed a mysterious glow on its hanging scroll,
the painting an ink sketch of a Zen monk fording a shallow stream.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he noticed an insignia that had been painted on the
sliding doors with a giant brush. He struggled to focus, and finally grasped
that it was the Minoan double ax, logo of the Daedalus Corporation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jesus!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He lay a minute, nursing the ache in his head and trying to
remember what had happened. All he could recall was London, money, Eva . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Eva. Where was she?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He popped erect and surveyed the room. It was traditional Jap
anese, the standard four-and-a-half tatami in size, bare and Spartan. A classic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But the music. It seemed to be coming through the walls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The walls. They all looked to be rice paper. He clambered up
and headed for the fusuma with the double-ax logo. He tested it and realized
that the paper was actually painted steel. And it was locked. The room was
secure as a vault.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But across, opposite the <i>tokonoma</i>, was another set of
sliding doors. As he turned to walk over, he noticed he was wearing <i>tabi</i>,
light cotton stockings split at the toe, and he was clad in a blue-patterned <i>yukata</i> 
robe, cinched at the waist. He'd been stripped and re-dressed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This door was real, and he shoved it open. A suite of rooms
lay beyond, and there on a second futon, still in a drugged sleep, lay Eva. He
moved across, bent down, and shook her. She jerked away, her dreaming
disrupted, and turned over, but she didn't come out of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Wake up.&quot; He shook her again. &quot;The party just
got moved. Wait'll you get a load of the decor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What . . .&quot; She rolled back and cracked open her
bloodshot eyes. Then she rose on one elbow and gazed around the room. It was
appointed identically to his, with only the hanging scroll in the <i>tokonoma</i>
different, hers being an angular, three-level landscape. &quot;My God.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Welcome to the wonderful world of Tanzan Mino. I don't
know where the hell we are, but it's definitely not Kansas, or London.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My head feels like I was at ground zero when the bomb
hit. My whole body aches.&quot; She groaned and plopped back down on the futon.
&quot;What time do you think it is?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Haven't a clue. How about starting with what day?&quot;
He felt for his watch and realized it was gone. &quot;What does it matter
anyway? Nobody has clocks in never-never land.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Satisfied she was okay, he stood up and surveyed the room.
Then he saw what he'd expected. There in the center of the ceiling, integrated
into the pattern of light-colored woods, was the glass eye of a video camera.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And the music. Still the faint music.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He walked on down to the far end of her room and shoved aside
another set of sliding doors, also painted with the double-ax insignia. He
found himself looking at a third large space, this one paneled in raw cypress.
It was vast, and in the center was a cedar hot tub, sunk into the floor. The
water was fresh and steaming, and two tiny stools and rinsing pails were
located conveniently nearby on the redwood decking. It was a traditional <i>o-furo</i>,
one of the finest he'd ever seen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're not going to believe this.&quot; He turned back
and waved her forward. In the soft rice-paper glow of the lamp she looked
rakishly disheveled. Japanese architecture always made him think of lovemaking.
&quot;Our host probably figured we'd want to freshen up for the festivities.
Check it out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What?&quot; She was shakily rising, pulling her yukata
around her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All the comforts of home. Too bad they forgot the geisha.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She came over and stood beside him. &quot;I don't believe
this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Want to see if it's real, or just a mirage?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She hesitantly stepped onto the decking, then walked out and
bent down to test the water. &quot;Feels wet.&quot; She glanced back. &quot;So
what the heck. I could use it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm ready.&quot; He kicked off his tabi and walked on
out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She pulled off his <i>yukata</i>, then picked up one of the
pails and began filling it from a spigot on the wall. &quot;Okay, exalted
male,&quot; she laughed, &quot;I'm going to scrub you. That's how they do it,
right?&quot; She stood up and reached for a sponge and soap.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They know how to live. Here, let me.&quot; He picked up
a second sponge and began scrubbing her back in turn. &quot;How does it
feel?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe this is heaven.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hope we didn't have to die to get here. But hang on. I've
got a feeling the fun is just beginning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He splashed her off with one of the pails, then watched as
she gingerly climbed down into the wooden tub.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, where do you think we are?&quot; She sighed as
the steam enveloped her. &quot;This has got to be Japan, but where?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Got a funny feeling I know.&quot; He was settling into
the water beside her. &quot;But if I told you, you'd probably think I'm
hallucinating.&quot; Above the tub, he suddenly noticed yet another video
camera.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they lay soaking, the <i>koto </i>music around them abruptly
stopped, its poignant twangs disappearing with an electronic click.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you finding the accommodations adequate?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The voice was coming from a speaker carefully integrated into
the raw cypress ceiling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All things considered, we'd sooner be in Philadelphia.&quot;
Vance looked up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm sorry to hear that,&quot; the voice continued.
&quot;No expense has been spared. My own personal quarters have been placed at
your disposal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mind telling me who's watching me bathe?&quot; Eva
splashed a handful of water at the lens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You have no secrets from me, Dr. Borodin. However, in
the interest of propriety I have switched off the monitor for the bath. I'm
afraid my people were somewhat overly zealous, installing one there in the
first place.&quot; The voice chuckled. &quot;But I should think you'd know. I
am CEO of the Daedalus Corporation, an organization not unfamiliar to
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right,&quot; she said, &quot;so where are we?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why, you are in the corporation's Hokkaido facility. As
my guests. Since you two have taken such an interest in this project, I thought
it only fitting you should have an opportunity to see it first hand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mind giving us a preview of the upcoming agenda?&quot;
Vance leaned back. &quot;We need to plan our day.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Quite simply, I thought it was time you and I got
reacquainted, Dr. Vance. It's been a long time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Eight years.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes. Eight years . . .&quot; There was a pause.
&quot;If you would excuse me a moment, I must take a call.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The speaker clicked off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, I've got a very bad feeling about all
this.&quot; She was rising from the bath, her back to the camera. &quot;What do
you think he's going to do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He's going to kill us, Vance realized. After he's played with
us a while. It's really quite simple.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know,&quot; he lied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the speaker clicked on again. &quot;Please forgive me.
There are so many demands on my time. However, I was hoping you, Dr. Vance,
would consent to join me this afternoon for tea. We have some urgent matters to
discuss.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll see if I can work it into my schedule.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Given the hectic goings-on here at the moment, perhaps
a quiet moment would be useful for us both.&quot; He paused again, speaking to
someone else, then his voice came back. &quot;Shall we say four o'clock.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What time is it now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Please forgive me. I forgot. Your world is not regimented
by time, whereas mine regrettably is measured down to seconds. It is now almost
three in the afternoon. I shall expect you in one hour. Your clothes are in the
closet in your room. Now, if you will allow me. Affairs . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

stared at the green screen, its numbers scrolling the computerized countdown.
&quot;Eighteen fucking hours.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he wheeled around, gazing over the beehive of activity in
Flight Control, he could already feel the adrenaline beginning to build.
Everything depended on him now. The vehicle was as ready as it was going to be:
all the wind tunnel tests, all the computer simulations, even the supersonic
test flights—everything said go. <i>Daedalus I</i> was going to make history
tomorrow morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Except, he told himself, it's going to be a very
different history from the one everybody expects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Major Yuri Andreevich Androv, please report to Hangar
Quadrant immediately.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The stridency of the facility's paging system always annoyed
him. He glanced at the long line of computer screens one last time, then
shrugged and checked his watch. Who wanted him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, a new planeload of Soviet VIPs reportedly had flown in
yesterday, though he hadn't seen any of them yet. He figured now that
everything looked ready, the <i>nomenklatura </i>were flooding in to bask in
triumph. Maybe after a day of vodka drinking and back slapping with the
officials in Project Management, they'd sobered up and realized they were
expected to file reports. So they were finally getting around to talking to the
people who were doing the actual work. They'd summon in a few staffers who had
hands-on knowledge of the project and commission a draft report, which they'd
then file, unread, under their own names. Typical.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He reached for his leather flight jacket, deciding on a brisk
walk to work off the tension. The long corridor leading from the East Quadrant
to the Hangar Quadrant took him directly past Checkpoint Central and the entry
to West Quadrant, the Soviet sector, which also contained the flight simulator
and the main wind tunnel, or Number One, both now quiet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he walked, he thought again about the new rumor he'd heard
in the commissary at lunch. Gossip kept the Soviet staff going—an instinct from
the old days—but this one just might be true. Some lower-level staffers even
claimed they'd seen him. The Chief.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Word was Tanzan Mino himself—none other than the CEO of the
Daedalus Corporation—had flown in this morning, together with his personal
bodyguards and aides. The story was he wanted hands-on control of the first hypersonic
test flight, wanted to be calling the shots in Flight Control when <i>Daedalus
I </i>made history.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Finally. The Big Man has decided to show his face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yuri Andreevich, just a minute. Slow down.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He recognized the voice immediately and glanced around to see
Nikolai Vasilevich Grishkov, the portly Soviet chief mechanic, just emerging
from the West Quadrant. His bushy eyebrows hung like a pair of Siberian musk-ox
horns above his gleaming dark eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have you seen her?&quot; Grishkov was shuffling toward
him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Seen who?&quot; He examined the mechanic's spotless
white coveralls. Jesus! Even the support crews on this project were all
sanitized, high-tech.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The new woman. <i>Kracevia, moi droog. Ochen kracevia</i>.
Beautiful beyond words. And she is important. You can tell just by
looking.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nikolai, there's never been a woman in this
facility.&quot; He laughed and continued on toward Security. &quot;It's worse
than a goddam troop ship. You've finally started hallucinating from lack of <i>pezdyonka</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yuri Andreevich, she's here and she's Soviet.&quot; The
chief mechanic followed him. &quot;Some believe she arrived this morning with
the CEO, but nobody knows who she is. One rumor is she's Vera Karanova.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who?&quot; The name was vaguely familiar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;T-Directorate. Like I said, no one knows for sure, but
that's what we've heard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Impossible.&quot; He halted and turned back, frowning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's just it, Yuri Andreevich,&quot; he sighed.
&quot;Those KGB bastards are not supposed to even know about this project.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>That was
everybody's strict understanding. We were to be free of them here. But now . .
.&quot; He caught the sleeve of Androv's flight jacket and pulled him aside,
out of the flow of pedestrian traffic in the hallway. &quot;My men were wondering.
Maybe you could find a way to check her out? You have better access. Everybody wants
to know what's going on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;KGB? It doesn't make any sense.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If she's really . . . I just talked to the project
kurirovat, Ivan Semenovich, and he told me Karanova's now number three in
T-Directorate.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, there's nothing we can do now, so the hell with
her.&quot; He waved his hand and tried to move on. &quot;We've both got better
things to worry about.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just keep your antenna tuned, my friend, that's all.
Let me know if you can find out anything. Is she really Karanova? Because if
she is, we damned well need to know the inside story.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nikolai, if I see her, I'll be sure and ask.&quot; He
winked. &quot;And if she's the hot number you say, maybe I'll find time to warm
her up a little. Get her to drop her . . . guard.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you succeed in that, <i>moi droog</i>,&quot; he said
as his heavy eyebrows lifted with a sly grin, &quot;you'll be the envy of the
facility. You've got to see her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can't wait.&quot; He shrugged and moved on toward the
Hangar Security station, at the end of the long corridor. When he flashed his
A-level priority ID for the two Japanese guards, he noticed they nervously made
a show of scrutinizing it, even though they both knew him perfectly well,
before saluting and authorizing entry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That nails it, he told himself. Out of nowhere we suddenly
have all this rule-book crap. These guys are nervous as hell. No doubt about
it, the big <i>nachalnik</i> is on the scene.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Great. Let all those assholes on the Soviet staff
see the expression on his face when the truth comes out. That's the real
history we're about to make here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he walked into the glare of neon, the cavernous space had
never seemed more vast, more imposing. He'd seen a lot of hangars, flown a lot
of experimental planes over the years, but nothing to match this. Still, he
always reminded himself, Daedalus was only hardware, just more fancy iron. What
really counted was the balls of the pilot holding the flight stick.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's when he saw them, clustered around the vehicle and
gazing up. He immediately recognized Colonel-General of Aviation Anatoly
Savitsky, whose humorless face appeared almost weekly in Soviet Military
Review; Major- General Igor Mikhailov, whose picture routinely graced the pages
of Air Defense Herald; and also Colonel-General Pavel Ogarkov, a marshal of the
Soviet air force before that rank was abolished by the general secretary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What are those Air Force neanderthals doing here? They're all
notorious hardliners, the &quot;bomb first, ask questions later&quot; boys. And
<i>Daedalus</i> is supposed to be for space research, right? Guess the bullshit
is about to be over. We're finally getting down to the real scenario.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And there in the middle, clearly the man in charge, was a
tall, silver-haired Japanese in a charcoal silk suit. He was showing off the
vehicles as though he owned them, and he carried himself with an authority that
made all the hovering Soviet generals look like bellboys waiting for a tip.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, Yuri Andreevich thought, for the time being he does own
them. They're bought and paid for, just like us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Tovarisch</i>, Major Androv, <i>kak pazhavatye</i>,&quot;
came a voice behind him. He turned and realized it belonged to General Valentin
Sokolov, commander of the MiG 31 wing at the Dolinsk air base on Sakhalin.
Sokolov was three star, top man in all the Soviet Far East. Flanking him were
half a dozen colonels and lieutenant colonels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Comrade General Sokolov.&quot; He whipped off a quick
salute. Brass. Brass everywhere. Shit. What in hell was this all about?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now the project director, Taro Ikeda, had broken away from
the Soviet group and was approaching. &quot;Yuri Andreevich, thank you for
coming.&quot; He bowed deferentially. &quot;You are about to receive a great
honor. The CEO has asked for a private conference with you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yuri stared over Ikeda's shoulder at the Man-in-Charge. All
this right-wing brass standing around kissing his ass counted for nothing. He
was the one calling the shots. Who was everybody kidding?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now the CEO looked his way, sizing him up with a quick
glance. Yuri Androv assessed him in turn. It was one look, but they both knew
there was trouble ahead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Tanzan Mino patted a colonel-general on the shoulder and
headed over. &quot;Yuri Andreevich Androv, I presume,&quot; he said in flawless
Russian, bowing lightly. &quot;A genuine pleasure to meet you at last. There's
a most urgent matter we have to discuss.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=bookmark70><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At the precise hour, the <i>tokonoma </i>alcove off Vance's
bedroom rotated ninety degrees, as though moved by an unseen hand, and what
awaited beyond was a traditional Japanese sand-and-stone garden. It was, of
course, lit artificially, but the clusters of green shrubs seemed to be thriving
on the fluorescents. Through the garden's grassy center was a curving pathway
of flat stepping stones placed artfully in irregular curves, and situated on
either side of the walkway were towering rocks nestled in glistening sand that
had been raked to represent ocean waves. The rocks were reminiscent of the
soaring mountains in Chinese Sung landscape paintings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance's attention, however, was riveted on what awaited at
the end of the stony walkway. It was a traditional teahouse, set in a grove of
flowering azaleas. And standing in the doorway was a silver-haired figure
dressed in a formal black kimono. He was beckoning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did I neglect to tell you I prefer Japanese <i>cha-no-yu
</i>to the usual British afternoon tea?&quot; Tanzan Mino announced. &quot;It
is a ritual designed to renew the spirit, to cleanse the mind. It goes back
hundreds of years. I always enjoy it in the afternoon, and I find it has
marvelously restorative powers. This seemed the ideal occasion for us to meet
and chat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't want to slight tradition.&quot; Vance slipped on
the pair of wooden clogs that awaited at the bottom of the path.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My feelings entirely,&quot; the CEO continued, smiling
as he watched him approach. &quot;You understand the Japanese way, Dr. Vance,
which is one reason we have so much to discuss.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He bowed a greeting as Vance deposited his clogs on the
stepping stone by the teahouse door. Together they stooped to enter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A light murmur of boiling water came from a brazier set into
the <i>tatami</i>-matted floor, but otherwise the room was caught in an
ethereal silence. The decor was more modern than most teahouses, with fresh
cedar and pine for the ceiling and walls rather than the customary reed, bark,
and bamboo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tanzan Mino gestured for him to sit opposite as he
immediately began the formalities of ritually cleaning the bamboo scoop, then
elevating the rugged white tea bowl like an ancient chalance and ceremonially
wiping it. All the while his eyes were emotionless, betraying no hint of what
was in his mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After the utensils were ceremonially cleansed, he wordlessly
scooped a portion of pale-green powdered tea into the bowl, then lifted a
dipperful of boiling water from the kettle and poured it in. Finally he picked
up a bamboo whisk and began to whip the mixture, continuing until it had acquired
the consistency of green foam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Authority, control, and—above all—discipline. Those
things, Vance knew, were what this was really about. As was traditional and
proper, not a word was spoken. This was the Zen equivalent of High Mass, and
Tanzan Mino was silently letting him know he was a true master—of himself, of
his world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the <i>oyabun </i>reached over and formally presented
the bowl, placing it on the <i>tatami  </i>in front of his guest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Vance lifted it up, rotated it a half turn in his
hand, and took a reserved sip. As the bitter beverage assaulted his mouth, he
found himself thinking this was probably intended to be his Last Supper. He
hoped he remembered enough to get the moves right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He sipped one more time, then wiped the rim, formally
repositioned the bowl on the <i>tatami</i>, and leaned back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Perfectly done,&quot; Tanzan Mino smiled as he
broke the silence. &quot;I'm impressed.&quot; He nodded toward the white bowl.
&quot;Incidentally, you were just handling one of the finest pieces in all
Japan.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shino ware. Mino region, late sixteenth century. Remarkably
fine glaze, considering those kilns had just started firing <i>chawan</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You have a learned eye, Dr. Vance.&quot; He smiled
again, glancing down to admire the rough, cracked surface of the rim. &quot;The
experts disagree on the age, some saying very early seventeenth century, but I
think your assessment is correct. In any case, just handling it always soothes
my spirit. The discipline of the samurai is in a <i>chawan</i> like this. And
in the <i>cha-no-yu</i> ceremony itself. It's a test I frequently give my
Western friends. To see if they can grasp its spirituality. I'm pleased to say
that you handled the bowl exactly as you should have. You understand that Japanese
culture is about shaping the randomness of human actions to a refined
perfection. That's what we really should be discussing here this afternoon, not
the world of affairs, but I'm afraid time is short. I often think of life in
terms of a famous Haiku by the poet Shiki:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sounds more like your new airplane,&quot; Vance
observed, then translated:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>A mortal

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;A passable enough rendering, if I may say,
though I don't necessarily accept your analogy.&quot; He reached down and
lifted a bottle of warmed sake from beside the brazier. &quot;By the way, I
know you prefer tequila, one of your odd quirks, but there was no time to
acquire any. Perhaps this will suffice.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He set down two black <i>raku</i> saucers and began to pour.
&quot;Now, alas, we must proceed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Post time, Vance thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Michael Vance.&quot; He lifted his saucer in a
toast. &quot;A scholar of the lost Aegean civilizations, a former operative of
the Central Intelligence Agency, and finally a private consultant affiliated
with a group of mercenaries. I had your file updated when I first heard you
were involved. I see you have not been entirely idle since our last encounter.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You haven't done too bad yourself.&quot; Vance toasted
him back. &quot;This new project is a big step up from the old days. Has a lot
of style.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It does indeed,&quot; he nodded. &quot;I'm quite proud
of our achievement here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You always thought big.&quot; Vance sipped again at his
sake, warm and soothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's kind of you to have remembered.&quot; Mino drank
once more, then settled his saucer on the <i>tatami </i>and looked up. &quot;Of
course, any questions you have, I would be—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, how's this. What do you expect to get out of
me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He laughed. &quot;Why nothing at all. Our reunion here is
merely intended to serve as a tutorial. To remind you and others how upsetting
I find intrusions into my affairs.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then how about starting off this 'tutorial' with a look
at your new plane?&quot; Vance glanced around. &quot;Guess I should call it <i>Daedalus</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Daedalus I </i>and<i> II. </i>There actually are two
prototypes, although only one is currently certified to operate in the hypersonic
regime. Yes, I expected the <i>Daedalus</i> would intrigue you. You are a man
of insatiable intellectual appetite.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not sure that's necessarily a compliment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It wasn't necessarily meant to be. Sometimes curiosity
needs to be curbed. But if we can agree on certain matters, I shall enjoy
providing you a personal tour, to satisfy that curiosity. You are a man who can
well appreciate both my technological achievement and my strategic coup.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The old boy's finally gone off the deep end, Vance told himself.
Megalomania. &quot;Incidentally, by 'strategic coup' I suppose you're referring
to the fact you've got them exactly where you want them. The Soviets.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; His eyes hardened slightly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know what I mean. They probably don't realize it yet,
but you're going to end up with the Soviet Far East in your wallet. For the
price of a hot airplane, you get to plunder the region. They're even going to
be thanking you while you reclaim Sakhalin for Japan. This <i>Daedalus</i>
spaceship is going to cost them the ranch. Have to admit it's brilliant. Along
with financing the whole scheme by swindling Benelux tax dodgers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You are too imaginative for your own good, Dr.
Vance,&quot; he said, a thin smile returning. &quot;Nobody is going to believe
your interpretation of the protocol.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You've got a point. Nobody appreciates the true brilliance
of a criminal mind. Or maybe they just haven't known you as long as I
have.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Really, I'd hoped we would not descend to trading insults.&quot;
He reached to refill Vance's sake saucer. &quot;It's demeaning. Instead I'd
hoped we could proceed constructively.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why not.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well then, perhaps you'll forgive me if I'm somewhat
blunt. I'm afraid my time is going to be limited over the next few hours. I may
as well tell you now that we are about to have the first hypersonic test of the
<i>Daedalus</i>. Tomorrow morning we will take her to Mach 25. Seventeen
thousand miles per hour. A speed almost ten times greater than any
air-breathing vehicle has ever before achieved.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The sky's the limit,&quot; he whistled quietly. Alex
hadn't known the half of it. This was the ultimate plane.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Impressive, I think you'll agree.&quot; Mino smiled and
poured more sake for himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Congratulations.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thank you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That ought to grease the way in the Diet for your deal.
And the protocol's financial grab ought to sail through the Supreme Soviet. You
prove this marvel can work and the rest is merely laundering your
profits.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So I would like to think,&quot; he nodded. &quot;Of
course, one never knows how these things will eventually turn out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So when do I get a look at it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why, that all depends on certain agreements we need to
make.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I guess it's time I heard the bottom line.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Most assuredly.&quot; He leaned back. &quot;Dr. Vance,
you have just caused me considerable hardship. Nor is this the first occasion
you have done so. Yet, I have not achieved what I have to date without becoming
something of a judge of men. The financial arrangements you put together in
London demonstrated, I thought, remarkable ingenuity. There could be a place
for you in my organization, despite all that has happened between us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't work for the mob, if that's what you're
hoping.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't be foolhardy. Those days are well behind
me,&quot; he went on calmly, despite the flicker of anger in his eyes.
&quot;The completion of this project will require financial and strategic
skills well beyond those possessed by the people who have worked for me in the
past.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All those petty criminals and hoods, you mean.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I will choose to ignore that,&quot; he continued.
&quot;Whatever you may wish to call them, they are not proving entirely
adequate to the task at hand. You bested my European people repeatedly and
brought me a decided humiliation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Speaking of which, Vance found himself suddenly wondering, a
thought out of the blue, what's happened to Vera? She's been European point
woman for this whole scam. Where's she now?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mino continued. &quot;Therefore I must now either take you
into my organization or . . .&quot; He paused. &quot;It's that simple. Which, I
wonder, will it be?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance studied him. &quot;A lot depends on what happens to
Eva.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The fate of Dr. Borodin depends largely on your
decision. So perhaps I should give you some time to think it over.&quot; He
leaned back. &quot;Or perhaps some inducement.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance didn't know what he meant. At first. Then he turned and
looked behind him. There waiting on the stony walkway of the garden were three
of Tanzan Mino's personal <i>kobun</i>, two of whom he recognized from London.
The CEO's instructions to them were in rapid-fire Japanese, but he needed no
translation as they moved forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

Tanzan Mino, he knew he'd been screwed. Sticking a couple of &quot;pilots&quot;
from Mino Industries in the cockpit. It was just the old GRU trick,
surveillance under the specious guise of &quot;support.&quot; He'd seen it all
before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But he'd had an idea. A flash. What about the woman Nikolai
had seen? The one he said was T-Directorate?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A knockout. That's what Nikolai had claimed, so she shouldn't
be hard to track down. He'd been methodically working the crowded corridors of
the North Quadrant, checking every open doorway. Although the facility was huge
and sprawling, he figured she'd probably be somewhere here close to Command
Sector.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Where the hell could she be?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One thing was sure: Tanzan Mino was as sharp as all the
rumors said. The bastard had been on-site for less than a day and already he'd
suspected that something was brewing. So he'd made his own preemptive strike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The problem now was, how to outsmart him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This T-Directorate operative had to be the way. After he got
her into a receptive mood, he'd lay out his case. Point out he had enough to
worry about in the cockpit without playing flight instructor to a couple of
Mino Industries greenhorns. He'd never flown an experimental plane with
civilian copilots and he damned sure wasn't going to start now. Especially now.</span></p>

Where the hell was she?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He continued methodically checking the North Quadrant offices
just down from the Command Sector, hoping somebody there had seen her. The whole
place was getting hectic now: last-minute briefings right and left. Whenever
he'd spot a friendly Russian face, he'd collar its owner to inquire about her.
Fortunately he had an A-level pass, so all he had to do was flash it to the
security stiffs at each sector checkpoint and they'd wave him past. He'd just
talked to a couple of flight engineers coming out of a briefing room who
claimed they'd spotted her in the hallway no more than half an hour ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But why was she here at all? It made no sense. Unless she'd
defected, gone to work for Mino Industries. Which was exactly the kind of thing
you'd expect from one of those opportunistic KGB bastards.</span></p>

headed for Sector Control and flanked by two Japanese security types. They were
striding close by, probably showing her around. Maybe she was worried about
safety here with all these sex-starved engineers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Odd, but her walk wasn't exactly what he'd expected. Seemed a
little too knowing. Guess that's what happens when you spend too much time in
the decadent capitalist West.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

&quot;<i>Kak pazhavatye</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>She whirled around. Moving in fast was a tall
and—admit it—not bad-looking Soviet major.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Ya </i>Yuri Andreevich Androv,&quot; he declared
with a light, debonair bow. His Russian was cultivated, Moscow. &quot;They tell
me you just got here. Thought we should meet. You've probably heard of
me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have no idea who you are,&quot; she heard herself
saying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Where the hell did they take Michael? she was wondering.
Right after he met with Tanzan Mino, he'd disappeared. And now she was being
moved. She didn't know where, but she did know one thing: all the phony politeness
was over. Things had gotten very rough, very fast. She was being relocated to a
secure location in the Soviet section, or so she suspected, but she figured
project management mainly just wanted to keep her out of the way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Right now, though, she had an agenda of her own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm a servant of the people.&quot; The major who called
himself Yuri Androv winked. &quot;Like you. I'm frequently asked to try and
kill myself in their behalf.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know—&quot; she tried to answer, but the
Japanese guards were roughly pulling her on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm the test pilot for the vehicle,&quot; he finally
announced.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How lovely.&quot; She glared at him. &quot;I hope it's
going to be a smashing success.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm about to find out. Tomorrow morning. Right now all
I want to do is try and get back in one piece. Which is why I need to talk to
you.&quot; He caught her arm, temporarily blocking the two uniformed Mino
Industries guards. Then he continued on in Russian. &quot;I've got a problem.
We've got a problem. I was hoping you could help me out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When the two security men tried to urge her on, he flashed
his A-level at them and told them to lay the fuck off, in explicit Russian.
Startled, they froze.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's when it finally dawned on her. This idiot must think
I'm Vera.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

and offering her one. Instinctively, she reached out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So how can I help you, Major Androv?&quot; Eva flashed
him a smile as he lit her English Oval with a match.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's the test flight tomorrow. Nobody should be near
that cockpit who hasn't been certified to at least ten G's in the simulator. I
tried to tell him, but he wouldn't listen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ten G's?&quot; She was trying to keep him talking.
&quot;That's—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Damned dangerous. But we need it to bring the scramjets
up to rated thrust, at least the first time. They've never been tested in
flight. We just don't know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And nobody else here has been certified?&quot; She
wasn't even sure exactly what &quot;certified&quot; meant, but she tried to
look concerned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Exactly. Now all of a sudden he wants to stick
a couple of his Nips in the cockpit there with me, probably crop-duster
screw-ups from Mino Industries.&quot; He finally lit his own cigarette, with a suggestive
flourish. Christ, she thought, why do all Soviet pilots think they're God's
gift to women. &quot;I tell you it's idiotic.&quot; He exhaled through his
nose. &quot;You've got to help me make him see that, before it's too
late.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

their blank faces she realized they hadn't understood a word.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What you're saying, Major, is very disturbing. Perhaps
we should have a word with the CEO right away. We both know time's getting
short.&quot; She glanced down the hall toward the wide doors at the end:
Command Sector. &quot;Why don't we just go in together and see him?&quot; She'd
noticed the major's A-level, which seemed to carry clout. &quot;Maybe you can
deal with these flunkies.&quot; She indicated the <i>Mino-gumi kobun </i>posing
as her guards. &quot;Since I neglected to bring my pass, they have no idea who
I really am.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

a surprise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>God, nobody can strut like a Soviet Air Force pilot. Hard
currency stores, scotch from Scotland, American cigarettes, French porno

Tanzan Mino all over your case. Maybe you'll end up so rattled tomorrow you'll
crash and burn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned and waved his pass at the two guards. &quot;<i>Mino-san

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Then he seized her arm and pushed the guards aside.
&quot;Come on. Maybe you can get these fuck-ups fired after we're
through.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll see what I can do.&quot; She smiled again.
&quot;By the way, you're confirming that the big test flight is still on? In
the morning?&quot; She paused, still not sure exactly what the test was all
about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh-nine-thirty hours. All the way.&quot; He was leading

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

Brush the stars. And believe me, I've got to be alone. I can't be running a

shoulder. &quot;Which is why you've got to help me talk some sense into that
old fucker. Excuse me,&quot; he said, grinning in mock apology, &quot;the
CEO.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The guards at the wide double doors leading into Tanzan
Mino's suite just gaped as Yuri Andreevich Androv flourished his A-level at
them and then shoved his way past, oblivious to the clamor of Japanese shouts
now trailing in his wake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Mino-san, pazhalsta</i>,&quot; he said to the figure
standing in the anteroom, scarcely noticing it was a woman, and too expensively
dressed for a receptionist. Eva watched Vera Karanova lunge for a button on the
desk as he pushed open the teakwood door leading into Tanzan Mino's inner
office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first thing she noticed was the wide window behind the
desk opening on a stunning view of the straits, the setting sun glancing off
the tips of the whitecaps. Seated behind the desk, monitoring a line of
computer screens, was a silver-haired executive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So that's what he looks like, she thought. Perfect. Central

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yuri Andreevich, what . . . ?&quot; he glanced up,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

&quot;If you so much as lay a finger on Michael or me, either one of us, the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Everything is being taken care of, Dr. Borodin.&quot;
Vera Karanova answered from the doorway. Eva glanced back and saw a platoon of
eight <i>Mino-guchi kobun</i>, Mino's personal bodyguards, all with automatics.
&quot;You will come with us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

you, everybody. We found out—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My name is Eva Borodin. I'm director of Soviet SIGINT
for the National Security Agency in Washington. And Mike Vance, CIA, is here

about to take you apart too, hotshot. So have a nice day. And while you're at
it—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

foolish.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Borodin,&quot; Mino finally spoke, &quot;you are
even more resourceful than I'd expected. Resourcefulness, however, is not
prudence. Dr. Vance is currently . . . reviewing a proposal I made him. You
should be hoping he will accept. As for the National Security Agency, they
believe you are still on holiday. After tomorrow, it will not matter. Nothing
you can do will interfere with our schedule.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room was cold. Just cold. That was the first thing he'd
noticed when they shoved him in. It still was. For nine hours he'd been sitting
on a hard, canvas-covered Soviet cot, shivering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The place was no larger than a small cell, with a tile floor,
ice gray concrete walls, and two bare fluorescent bulbs for lighting. No heat.
There was a slight vibration—it seemed to be part of the room itself—emanating
from the walls and floor. He'd tracked it to a large wall duct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ventilation system could use adjusting, he'd thought, fan
housing's loose somewhere. They also could turn up the damned heat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was wearing only what he'd had on in London, and this
definitely was not London. Hokkaido was a much colder part of the planet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room had the feeling of a quick, slapped-together job.
But it also looked like it could withstand a medium-sized nuclear detonation.
One thing was sure, though: It wasn't built with comfort in mind. The door was
steel, the same dull hue as the rest. It was bolted from the outside, naturally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But if isolation and cold were Tanzan Mino's idea of how to
break his spirit, to see how tough he was, the man was in for some
disappointment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What the Mino Industries CEO had unwittingly accomplished by
moving him here, however, was to enlighten him about the layout of the place.
As he was being escorted down the crowded facility corridors by the three
leather-jacketed <i>kobun</i>, he'd passed a projection video screen suspended
over the center of a main intersection. The location seemed to be some sort of
central checkpoint, and the screen displayed a schematic of the whole facility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd faked a stumble and used the recovery time to quickly
scan its essential features.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He leaned back on the cot and ran through one more time what
he'd seen on the screen, trying to imprint it in his memory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Insight number one: the facility was organized into four main
quadrants, with a layout like a large X. Some of the writing was Japanese, but
mostly it was Russian Cyrillic characters. He massaged his temples and
visualized it again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first thing he'd focused on was something called the
North Quadrant, whose Russian designation was Komendant. It looked to be the
command center, with a red-colored area labeled in both Japanese and Russian.
Next to that were a lot of little rooms, probably living quarters or barracks.
Kanji ideograms identified those, so that section was probably where the
Japanese staffers bivouacked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That command section, he'd realized, was where he and Eva had
been. They'd been quartered in a part of Tanzan Mino's private suites, the
belly of the beast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It got even more interesting. The other three quadrants were
where the real work was going on. On the right side of the screen was East
Quadrant, whose label was <i>Komputer/ Kommunekatseon, </i> which meant it
contained the computers and communications set-up. Flight Control. And the
South Quadrant, the <i>Assamblaya</i>, consisted of a lot of large open bays,
probably where the two prototypes had been assembled. Those bays connected
directly to a massive sector labeled <i>Angar</i>, the hangar. But the bays
also had separate access to the runway, probably for delivery of prefabricated
sections from somewhere else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The West Quadrant appeared to house test facilities; the one
label he could read was <i>Laboratoraya</i>. Probably materials labs, next to a
configuration that could have been a large wind tunnel. Made sense. That
quadrant also had more small rooms with Russian labels. He'd studied the screen
a second longer and . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Bingo. He'd realized he was being moved into the Soviet sector,
probably the barracks and laboratory area.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This had to be the least used location in the facility now,
he told himself. All the wind tunnel testing of sections and the materials
research was probably wrapped up, meaning this area was history. Yesterday's
news. So the CEO had shunted him to this obscure lock-up in the West Quadrant,
the Soviet section. What better spot to discreetly dispose of somebody for a
while?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Time to brush up your Russian.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Problem was—he grimaced at the realization—there wasn't a heck
of a lot left to brush. He'd had a year at Yale, just enough to let him
struggle along with a dictionary and squeak around some standard language
requirement. That was it. He'd never given it a second thought afterward.
Instead he'd gone on to his real love—ancient Greek. Then later, in CIA days,
the action had been Asia. At one time he'd ended up doing some consulting for
Langley's Far Eastern INTEL desk, helping coordinate American and Japanese
fieldwork.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He could swing the Japanese, but the Russian . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tanzan Mino probably knew that, yet another reason why he'd
decided on this transfer. There'd be fewer people here to communicate with.
Smart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The labyrinth of King Minos, brainchild of Daedalus, that's
what he felt trapped in. But Theseus, the Greek prince who killed the monster,
got some help from Minos's daughter, Ariadne. A ball of string to help him find
his way out of the maze. This time around, though, where was help going to come
from? Maybe the first job here was to kill the monster, then worry about what
came next.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Partly to generate a little body heat, he turned and braced
himself at an angle against the door, starting some half push-ups. With his
hands on the door, he also could sense some of the activity in the hallway
outside. He figured it had to be after midnight by now, but there were still
random comings and goings. Activity, but nothing . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He felt a tremor, then heard a loud scraping and the sound of
a bolt being slid aside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He quickly wheeled and flattened himself against the wall,
looking futilely for something to use as a weapon. Aside from the cot, though,
there was nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, this would be hand to hand. He could use the exercise.
Besides, he was mad enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The gray steel door slowly began to swing inward; then a mane
of white hair tentatively appeared, followed by a rugged ancient face as the
visitor turned to stare at him through heavy glasses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Strasvitye</i>,&quot; the man said finally,
uncertainty in his gravelly voice. &quot;<i>Ya Doktor Andrei Petrovich Androv</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Would the idea work? Yuri still didn't know. As he walked
between the vehicles, the hangar's wide banks of fluorescents glaring down on
the final preflight preps for <i>Daedalus I</i>, he was sure of only one thing:
at this point, the revised plan was the only option left. Would the American
help?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The woman, the bitch, was no fool: An insight he'd come by
the hard way. But maybe the CIA guy—what had she said his name was?—Vance?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How the hell did he get here? However it had happened, he was
being kept in the West Quadrant. It had been no trick to find him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was a godsend; his help would make the scenario possible.
Now it merely required split-second timing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He glanced up at the big liquid crystal display screen on the
far wall, noting it read zero minus eight hours ten minutes. He should be back
in the West Quadrant now, catching some sleep—if Taro Ikeda knew he was here in
the hangar, there'd be hell to pay—but time was running out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tanzan Mino had listened icily to his renewed arguments
against additional personnel in the cockpit, then declared that the viability
of the program depended on having backups. Merely an essential precaution. End
of discussion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Bullshit. As soon as the political games were played out, the
CEO was planning to get rid of him, probably by some &quot;accident.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, screw him. And that's where the American came in. The
thing to do was just appear to be proceeding with the countdown normally, keep
everything innocent. Then, at the last minute . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stared up at <i>Daedalus I </i>one last time, watching as
the maintenance crews finished the last of the preflight scramjet preps. And he
shook his head in amazement that Andrei Androv and all his damned propulsion
engineers could create a genuine technological miracle and still be total
bumblers when it came to what in hell was really happening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>These technical types thought they were so brilliant! But if
it had taken them all this time to realize they'd been fucked by Mino
Industries, then how smart could they really be? Made him wonder how the
Baikonur Cosmodrome ever managed to get so much as a turnip into orbit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now these same geniuses had to get <i>Daedalus II </i>flight-
ready in just a few hours, and had to do it without anyone suspecting what they
were doing. Finally, they had to be ready to roll into action the instant the
&quot;accident&quot; happened. No trial runs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He checked his watch and realized his father's propulsion
team was already gathering at Number One, the final meeting. The question now
was, could they really deliver? The American was the key.</span></p>

uncertain English, was the last thing he'd expected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who are you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;For this vehicle, I am Director Propulsion
System,&quot; he replied formally, and with pride, pulling at his white lab
coat. &quot;I must talk you. Please.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance stepped away from the wall and looked the old man over
more closely. Then it clicked. Andrei Petrovich Androv was a living legend. Ten
years ago the CIA already had a tech file on him that filled three of those
old-time reels of half-inch tape. These days, God knows what they had. He'd
been the USSR's great space pioneer, a hero who'd gone virtually unrecognized
by his own country. No Order of Lenin. Nothing. Nada. But maybe he'd preferred
it that way, liked being a recluse. Nobody, least of all the CIA's Soviet
specialists, could figure him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And now he was here in the wilds of northern Hokkaido,
building a spaceplane. They'd sent over no less than the Grand Old Man to
handle the propulsion. This project was top priority. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> A s it deserved to be. But the immediate question was, What
was the dean of Soviet rocket research doing here visiting him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sorry I can't offer you a cup of tea. No samovar.&quot;
He looked out the open door one last time. Several Soviet staffers were
glancing in as they walked by, obviously puzzled why the famous Doktor Androv
himself had come around to talk with some unknown civilian.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

color:windowtext'>&quot;Tea. <i>Chai</i>.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;Just a bad
joke.&quot; He reached over and shoved the door closed, then gestured toward
the cot. &quot;In the wrong language. Please. Sit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thank you.&quot; The old man settled himself. &quot;I
did not come for <i>chai</i>.&quot; His hands were trembling. &quot;I
want—&quot; Abruptly he hesitated, as though searching for words, and then his
mind appeared to wander. &quot;Your name is Vance?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mike Vance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Vance, my son is test pilot for the <i>Daedalus</i>.&quot;

to hear. &quot;That is why I am come. I am very worried for my son.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

worried. His severe, penetrating eyes were filled with anguish.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Got a problem with the CEO? Guess the godfather can be
a hard man to warm up to, even for his new allies.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Vance, I do not know you, but there is very small
time.&quot; He continued with a shrug, not understanding. &quot;So please, I
will tell you many things in very few minutes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance continued to study him. &quot;Go ahead.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You may not realize, but this project is to be giant
leap for our space program. Many of our best engineers are here. This vehicle,
a reusable near-earth space platform, would save billions of rubles over many
years. It is air-breathing vehicle that would lift research payloads directly
into space. But my son never believe that its real purpose. Perhaps I was
idealist, because I believe. I always think he was wrong. But more and more of
things I have learned about its electronics—things we had nothing to do
with—make me now believe he is right. And yesterday, when certain . . . <i>chelovek</i>
of the Soviet Air Force come, the worst . . .&quot; He paused, his voice
beginning to betray barely concealed rage. &quot;I have work all my life for
peaceful exploring of space. And now I have been betrayed. The engineers I
bring with me here have been betrayed. I also believe, Mr. Vance, that the
Soviet people have been betrayed. And along with them, Mikhail Sergeevich
himself. This is part of a plot to . . . I don't know what secretly is plan,
but I am now convinced this plane must be destroyed, before it is too late. And
the world must be warned. That is why—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then why don't you warn somebody?&quot; Vance interrupted
him. &quot;Matter of fact, there's a lot more to this setup than an
airplane.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;But why do you think I am here, talking to
you? The facility now is completely sealed. I would warn Mikhail Sergeevich
what is happening, but no communication is possible.&quot; He hesitated again,
painfully. &quot;They want to put my son in the airplane tomorrow with guards.
He has been made prisoner, like you. He does not want to fly the vehicle for
tomorrow's test, but the CEO is forcing him to do it.&quot; He looked up, his
eyes bleary and bloodshot. &quot;Mr. Vance, I think he will be killed as soon
as this plane is certified hypersonic. They no longer trust him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What about you? They probably won't think you're very
trustworthy either if they find out you came to see me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is correct. But the time has come for risks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what do you want from me?&quot; He stood back and
looked the white-haired old man over one last time. Was he telling the truth?
Were the Soviet engineers actually planning a mutiny?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We are going to stop it. Tomorrow morning, just before
the test flight. It must be done.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good luck.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Vance, you are with American intelligence. We are
only engineers. We know nothing about the kind of things necessary to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you have any weapons?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing. The guards here are all from the corporation.&quot;
He lowered his voice. &quot;Frankly, most of them look like criminals.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They are.&quot; Vance laughed in spite of himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't understand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know you don't understand. If you did . . . but
that's beside the point.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then will you help us?&quot; His wrinkled face was
fixed in determination. &quot;Do you know anything about explosives?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Enough. But are you really sure that's the way you want
to go?&quot; He paused. &quot;There's a lot that can go wrong in a big facility
like this without anybody knowing what caused it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All the sensitive areas are under heavy security now.
They are impossible to penetrate.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Terrific, Vance thought. &quot;By the way, how does your son,
the test pilot, figure into all this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All along he was planning to . . . I don't know. He
refused to tell me. But it doesn't matter. Now that two Mino Industries guards
are being put in the cockpit with him, whatever he was planning is impossible.
So we have to do something here, on the ground.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, where is he?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He is in the hangar now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll need to see him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For one thing, Vance thought, he probably knows how to use a
gun. All Soviet pilots carry an automatic and two seven-round clips for
protection in case they have to ditch in the wilderness somewhere. Our first
order of business is to jump some of these <i>Mino-gumi </i>goons who're posing
as security men and get their weapons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By the way, do you know where they're keeping the
American woman who was brought here with me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The old man's eyes grew vague. &quot;I believe she's somewhere
here in the West Quadrant. I think she was transferred here around eighteen
hundred hours, and then a little later her suitcase arrive from hangar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Her bag?&quot; His pulse quickened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Delivered by the facility's robot carts. The plane that
brought you was being made ready for the CEO's trip back to Tokyo.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where was it left?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know. I only—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, later. Right now maybe you'd better start by
getting me out of here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is why I brought this.&quot; He indicated the
brown paper package he was carrying. It was the first time Vance had noticed
it. &quot;I have in here an air force uniform. It belongs to my son.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The parcel was carefully secured with white string—a
methodical precision that came from years of engineering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You will pose as one of us,&quot; the old man
continued. &quot;You do not speak Russian?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe enough to fool the <i>Mino-gumi</i>, but nobody
else.&quot; He was watching as Androv began unwrapping the package.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then just let me do all talk,&quot; he shrugged.
&quot;If anybody wonders who you are, I will be giving you tour of the West
Quadrant. You should pretend to be drunk; it would surprise no one. You will
frown a lot and mumble incoherent questions to me. We will go directly to my
office, where I will tell you our plan.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Andrei Androv was unfolding a new, form-fitting uniform
intended for Yuri Andreevich. The shoulder boards had one wide gold chevron and
two small rectangles, signifying the rank of major in the Soviet air force.
Also included was a tall lamb's-wool cap, the kind officers wore. Vance took
the hat and turned it in his hand. He'd never actually held one before. Nice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Seems I just got made air force major, and I've never flown
anything bigger than a Lear jet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He slipped off the shirt he'd been wearing in London, happy
to be rid of it, and put on the first half of the uniform. Not a bad fit. The
trousers also seemed tailor-made. Then he slipped on the wool topper,
completing the ensemble.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You would make a good officer, I think.&quot; Andrei
Androv stood back and looked him over with a smile. &quot;But you have to act
like one too. Remember to be insulting.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After the hours in solitary, freezing confinement, he wasn't
sure he looked like anything except a bum. But he'd have no difficulty leading
Doktor Andrei Androv along in the middle of the night and bombarding him with a
steady stream of slurred Russian: <i>Shto eto? Ve chom sostoet vasha rabota?</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>How did the Soviets find out he was here? he
wondered. Must have been Eva. She'd got through to them somehow. Which meant
she probably was still all right. That, at least, was a relief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After Andrei Androv clanged the steel door closed and bolted
it, they headed together toward the old man's personal office, where he had
smuggled drawings of the vehicle's cockpit. The hallways were lit with glaring
fluorescents, bustling with technicians, and full of Soviets in uniform. Vance
returned a few of the crisp salutes and strutted drunkenly along ahead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They wanted him to help blow up the plane! He was a little
rusty with good old C-4, but he'd be happy to brush up fast. After that, it'd
be a whole new ballgame.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=bookmark77><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Friday 1:47<span style='text-transform:uppercase'> a.m.</span></span></b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Will he help?&quot; Yuri Androv surveyed the eleven men
in the darkened control room. The wall along the left side consisted entirely
of heavy plate glass looking out on Number One. That wind tunnel, the video
screens, the instrument panels, everything was dormant now. Aside from a few
panel lights, the space was illuminated only by the massive
eight-foot-by-twenty-foot liquid crystal screen at the far end now scrolling
the launch countdown, green numbers blinking off the seconds. Except for
Nikolai Vasilevich Grishkov, the Soviet chief mechanic, all those gathered were
young engineers from Andrei Androv's propulsion design team. Grishkov, however,
because of his familiarity with the layout of the hangar, was the man in
charge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I just spoke with Doktor Androv, and he believes the American
will cooperate,&quot; Grishkov nodded. &quot;He will bring him here as soon as
he has been briefed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I still wonder if I shouldn't just handle it
myself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It would be too dangerous for you, Yuri Andreevich. He
knows about explosives. Besides, you have to be ready to fly the other plane,<i>
Daedalus II</i>, right after the explosion. Nobody else can take it up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He laughed. &quot;Steal it, you mean.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yuri Andreevich, we have made sure it's fueled and we
will get you into the cockpit. After that, we will know nothing about—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;One other thing,&quot; he interjected, &quot;I want it
fueled with liquid hydrogen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Impossible.&quot; Grishkov's expression darkened, his
bushy eyebrows lifting. &quot;I categorically refuse.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't care. I want it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Absolutely out of the question. The engines on <i>Daedalus
II </i>haven't been certified in the scramjet mode. You can't attempt to take
it hypersonic. It would be too risky.&quot; He stopped, then smiled.
&quot;Don't worry. You can still outrun any chase plane on earth with those
twelve engines in ramjet mode.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I tell you I want to go to scramjet geometry,&quot;
Yuri Andreevich insisted, his eyes determined.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If I can't do what I planned, he told himself, nobody's going
to believe me. I've got to take one of those vehicles hypersonic tomorrow
morning, ready or not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Impossible. There's no way we can fuel <i>Daedalus II</i>
with liquid hydrogen. The Mino Industries ground crews would suspect something
immediately. It's out of the question. I forged some orders and had it fueled
with JP-7 late last night, at 2300 hours. That's the best I can do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Chort</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
Yuri thought. Well, maybe I can fake it. Push it out to Mach 5 with JP-7 and
still . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;And the two 'pilots' from Mino
Industries,&quot; he turned back, &quot;what about them?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If the American plays his part, they will never
suspect.&quot; Grishkov flashed a grin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Unless somebody here screws up,&quot; he said, gazing
around the room again, studying the white technician's uniforms, the innocent
faces.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There'll be a lot of confusion. When we start pumping
liquid hydrogen into <i>Daedalus /, </i>the site will be pandemonium,&quot;
Grishkov continued. &quot;All you have to do is get into the cockpit of the
other plane.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It would be a horrible accident, but accidents happened.
They'd all heard whispered stories about the tragedy at Baikonur in October
1960, when almost a hundred men were killed because Nikita Khrushchev wanted a
spectacular space shot while he was visiting the United Nations. When a giant
rocket, a Mars probe, failed to achieve ignition, instead of taking the delay
required to remove the fuel before checking the malfunction, the technicians
were ordered to troubleshoot it immediately. Tech crews were swarming over it
when it detonated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I guess we're ready.&quot; Yuri Andreevich sighed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We are.&quot; Grishkov nodded and reached for the phone
beside the main console, quickly punching in four numbers. He spoke quietly for
a few moments, then replaced the receiver.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They'll be here in five minutes. Doktor Androv has just
completed his briefing on the cockpit configuration.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right. I'm going now. Just get the hangar doors
open, the runway cleared, and the truck-mounted starters ready. This is going
to be tricky, so make sure everybody thinks we're merely taking <i>Daedalus II</i>
onto the runway as a safety precaution after the explosion.&quot; Yuri gazed
over the group of engineers one last time. Would they do it? Whatever happened,
he had to get out of there and start checking the cockpit of <i>Daedalus II </i>before
the morning's preflight crews arrived. &quot;Good luck. By 0900 hours I want
everything set.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He gave the room a final salute, out of habit, and headed for
the security doors. In moments he'd disappeared into the corridor and was gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me do the talking,&quot; Grishkov said, turning
back to the others. &quot;And let Doktor Androv translate. Also remember, he
has no idea Yuri Andreevich is going to steal the other plane.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The men stirred, and nodded their assent. From here on, they
all were thinking, the less they had to do with this plot the better.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the door opened. Standing next to Dr. Andrei Petrovich
Androv was a tall man dressed as a Soviet air force major. As Grishkov looked
him over, he had the fleeting impression that Yuri Andreevich had unexpectedly
returned, so similar was the American poseur to Andrei Androv's own son. In
height and build, the resemblance was nothing short of miraculous. This was
going to be easier than he'd dared to hope. Put the American in a pressure
suit, complete with flight helmet, and he could easily pass.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He has agreed to set the explosives,&quot; Andrei said
in Russian as he gestured toward the man standing beside him in a tight-fitting
uniform. &quot;Meet ‘Major Yuri Andreevich Androv.'&quot;</span></p>

color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room appeared to be the quarters of a high-ranking member
of the Soviet staff, now returned to the USSR. It was comfortably if sparely
appointed and even had a computer terminal, a small NEC. She'd switched it on,
tried to call up some files, but everything required a password. She could use
it, however, as a clock. As she watched the time flashing on the corner of the
screen, she tried to remember what the Soviet major had said about the schedule
. . . the first hypersonic test of the Daedalus was scheduled for 0930. That
was only an hour and a half away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was wearing her London clothes again, but where the hell
was her bag? She walked over and sat down on the side of the single bed,
thinking. If she could get her hands on the suitcase, the Uzi might still be
there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's when she heard the sound of muted but crisp Japanese
outside—the changing of the guard. The <i>Mino-gumi kobun </i>were keeping a
strict schedule, a precision that seemed perfectly in keeping with everything
else about the facility. Life here was measured out not in coffee spoons but in
scrolling numbers on computers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The door opened and one of the new <i>kobun</i> showed his head.
At first she thought it was merely a bed check, but he stared at her mutely for
a moment, then beckoned. She rose and walked over. This new goon, black suit
and all, was armed with a 9mm Walther P88 automatic in a shoulder holster.
Outside, the other <i>Mino-gumi </i>motioned for her to come with them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's when she noticed her bag, sitting just outside the
door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There goes my chance, she sighed. They want to keep me
moving, make sure I'm not in one place long enough for anybody to get
suspicious. This way I'll seem to be just another guest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without a word they were directing her along the hallway
toward Checkpoint Central. All Tanzan Mino's <i>kobun</i> seemed to have free
run of the facility, because the uniformed security staff didn't even bother to
ask for a pass. They may have been new and alien visitors from outside this
closed world, but they represented the CEO. Carte blanche.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now they were moving down the crowded corridor leading to the
South Quadrant. The walls were still gray, but this was a new area, one she
hadn't yet been in. No sign this time, however, of the Soviet major named
Androv.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Guess he wasn't kidding about an important test flight coming
up. Something was definitely in the wind. The pace of activity was positively
hectic. So why was she being moved, right in the middle of all this chaos? It
didn't make sense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked up ahead and realized they were headed toward two
massive, heavily guarded doors. What could this sector be? Once again the
Japanese security guards merely bowed low and waved her Mino-gumi escorts past.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The wide doors opened onto yet another hallway, and she was
overwhelmed by a blast of sound. Motors were blaring, voices were shouting,
escaping gasses were hissing. The din, the racket, engulfed her. And then she
realized the reason: There was no ceiling! Even the &quot;offices&quot; along
the side were merely high-walled cubicles that had been dropped here in the
entryway of some vast space.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was the hangar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The actual entry at the end was sealed and guarded, but
instead of passing through, they stopped at the last door on the right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whoever had summoned her, it wasn't Tanzan Mino. His array of
personal <i>kobun</i> weren't lined up outside. In fact, there were no guards
at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The leather-jacketed escorts pulled open the door, and one entered
ahead of her, one behind. Inside was a large metal desk, equipped with banks of
phones and rows of buttons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sitting behind the desk was Vera Karanova.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did you sleep well?&quot; She glanced up, then
immediately signaled for the <i>kobun</i> to absent themselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Did you?&quot; Eva looked her over—the severe
designer suit, black, topped off with a string of gray Mikimoto pearls. It was
a striking contrast to the short-haired engineers bustling outside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What riveted her attention, however, was resting on the desk
next to the banks of phones and switches. A Zenith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We have some time this morning.&quot; Vera ignored the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>response as
she brushed at her carefully groomed dark hair. &quot;I thought we should use
it productively.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Lots of luck, Comrade.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It is not in either of our interests to be at cross purposes,&quot;
she continued, still speaking in Russian. It was a startling change in tone
from the evening before. &quot;You and I have much in common. We both have
worked at high levels in the security apparatus of our respective countries.
Consequently we both understand the importance of strategic thinking. That sets
us apart.&quot; She reached out and touched the laptop computer. &quot;Now, to
begin, I would very much like for you to show me how you managed to break the
encryption for the protocol. The CEO was most impressed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If he wants to know, he can ask me himself.&quot; She
helped herself to a metal chair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He is very busy at the moment,&quot; Vera continued,
&quot;occupied elsewhere.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This is a setup, Eva was thinking. She wanted to get me down
here for some other reason.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But it was hard to concentrate, given the din of activity
filtering in from the open ceiling. Above them banks of floodlights were
creating heavy shadows around the office, and out there somewhere, she
realized, was the prototype.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why don't you tell me what's really on your mind,
Comrade? Or better yet, why you decided to throw in your lot with all these
Yakuza criminals.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vera Karanova laughed. &quot;You are a director with the
National Security Agency. You obviously are very competent. And yet you and the
rest of American intelligence seem completely blind. Oblivious to the
significance of what is happening around you. In case you hadn't noticed, the
Soviet military is being stripped, practically dismantled in the interest of
economic restructuring.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;High time, if you ask me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is a matter of opinion. The Cold War, whether we
liked it or not, maintained a predictable structure in the world. Both East and
West went out of their way to support and stabilize Third World countries in order
to keep them out of each other's camp. But with the Cold War slackening,
there's disintegration everywhere. Demilitarization is leading to political and
economic anarchy worldwide.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Right, Eva thought. But you left out one other interesting
fact: Japan got rich while the superpowers were out there
&quot;stabilizing&quot; everybody, squandering resources on matching sets of
military toys instead of investing in their own infrastructure. They'd love to
keep it going.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This plane,&quot; Vera went on, &quot;can be used to serve
the ultimate cause of restoring world order.&quot; She paused, then continued.
&quot;But only if it is in the hands of our air force, from today
forward.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Purge the new thinking?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Soviet Union is on the verge of economic disaster.
Perestroika has plunged our country into chaos. The time has come to admit
revisionism has failed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where's good old Uncle Joe when you need him?&quot; she
smiled. &quot;Stalin made the Gulag trains run on time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Our restructuring has gone too far,&quot; Vera
continued. &quot;There are limits beyond which a society can no longer endure
change.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Eva stared at her. &quot;I take it KGB and your military
right- wingers are planning to try and stage a coup?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There still are responsible people in the Soviet Union,
Dr. Borodin, who believe our country is worth saving.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God, Eva thought, their hard-liners are planning to take
control of this plane and use it to re-enflame the Cold War? Just like the race
for the H-bomb, it'll rejuvenate the Soviet military.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is our last chance,&quot; Vera continued as she
reached down and flicked on the computer. &quot;However, if we are to succeed,
the terms of the protocol will require certain revisions.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you really think you can get away with this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's where you come in,&quot; Vera went on. &quot;But
first perhaps I should show you something.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She reached down and pushed a button on the desk, causing the
set of blinds along the side of the office facing the hangar to slowly rise.
&quot;I'd like you to see the <i>Daedalus</i>.&quot; She pointed out the
window. &quot;Perhaps then you will better appreciate its significance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Through the glass was a massive hangar engulfed in white
vapor, as cryogenic liquid hydrogen created clouds of artificial condensate,
cold steam, that poured over the army of milling technicians. Above the haze,
however, she could just make out two giant aircraft. Their wings started almost
at the cockpit, then widened outward to the plane's full length, terminating
abruptly just before the high tail assembly. Positioned side by side, they
looked like huge gliders, except that beneath the wings were clusters of
massive engines larger than any she'd ever seen before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So that's the prototype, the vehicle specified in the
protocol.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They were stunningly beautiful. Maybe all high-performance
aircraft looked sexy, but these possessed a unique elegance. The child's vision
of the paper airplane reincarnated as the most powerful machine man had ever
created.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I thought you would like to witness the final preparations
for our first hypersonic flight,&quot; Vera proceeded. &quot;Thus far one of
the planes, that one there on the left&quot;— she pointed—&quot;has been flown
to Mach 4.5. Today's test will take it to the hypersonic regime, over fifteen
thousand miles per hour.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They've leapfrogged the West, Eva was suddenly realizing.
It's the X-30 spaceplane America dreams of building in the next century, except
it's here now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;From the looks of things, I'd say you're on
schedule.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vera clicked something on the desk and a blinking number
appeared at the top of a video screen. It was the countdown. Liftoff was less
than an hour away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, so far there has been no hold. Even though today
is overcast, with a low ceiling, we don't experience weather delays like the
American space shuttle. In fact, this plane is virtually weather-proof, since
it leaves from a runway just like a normal passenger jet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No wonder the test pilot Androv was swaggering, Eva thought.
This must be a flyboy's wet dream.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;One more question. Why are you showing me all
this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told you, there's something I need.&quot; She paused,
and in the silence Eva listened to the increasing clamor of preparations in the
hangar outside. &quot;After the test flight this morning, the prototype is
scheduled to be transferred to the Supreme Soviet. However, that cannot be
allowed to happen. Consequently, there will need to be alterations in the
protocol.&quot; She clicked on the laptop computer. It hummed lightly as the
hard disk engaged, and then the screen began to glow. &quot;Those revisions
need to be kept out of the system computers here at the facility for now, so your
copy of the text would be an ideal place to prepare a first draft.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're going to pull a fast one.&quot; Eva stared at
her. &quot;You're going to tinker with the terms of the deal and turn this
plane over to your air force. Very inventive.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is correct. And you are going to help me, Dr.
Borodin. You are going to call up your text and print a copy for me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sweetie, you are a piece of work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why bother printing it again? Sorry to tell you, but
I've already run off a copy. It's in my suitcase.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We searched your bag. There's nothing there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You didn't look hard enough.&quot; Maybe this was her
chance. &quot;Send some of your thugs to fetch it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very well.&quot; She reached for a button on the desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Eva turned to look out again through the white mist.
Something was going on now. A motorized cart was pulling up and two men in
pressure suits were getting off. Must be the pilots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first to step off the cart was already waving his hands
imperiously at the Japanese technicians. He had to be the Soviet pilot, Androv.
Yep, it was him, swagger and all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the second pressure-suited figure stepped down. That
one, she assumed, must be one of the Mino Industries recruits Androv had been
complaining about. Guess he didn't get very far with his demand to be in the
cockpit alone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The walk.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Memories of a long-ago skin-diving trip to Cozumel flooded
back. They were off the northern reefs, wearing oxygen tanks, admiring the
multicolored banks of coral. Then later, as they staggered up the beach, she'd
laughed at his frog-footed waddle. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Vance stepped off the motorized cart, the hangar around
him was shrouded in white vapor. The swirling cloud on the ground, the eerie
chiaroscuro of the lights, the amplified voice that ticked off the
countdown—all added to the other-worldliness of the scene. And above the
turmoil two giant spaceplanes loomed, silver monoliths that seemed to hover
atop the pale mist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Chariots of the gods, he thought, gazing up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Russian technicians had carefully suited him exactly as
Yuri Androv, right down to his boots. Next to his skin was the dark-blue flight
suit and cotton-lined leather cap issued to all Soviet pilots, and over these
came a pressurized G-suit fabricated from a heavy synthetic material; it felt
like a mixture of nylon and Teflon. This was topped off with the flight helmet,
complete with a removable reflecting visor, which conveniently prevented anyone
from seeing his face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Although the helmet restricted his peripheral vision, he
still could hear clearly through headphones miked on the outside, although they
did make the din of the hangar sound tinny and artificial. A Velcro-backed
insignia of the Minoan Double Ax adhered to his chest; he was posing as a Mino
Industries pilot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For all its unfamiliarity, however, his gear felt very much
like the rubber wet-suit he donned for scuba diving at depths. The two hoses
fastened to his abdomen could have been connectors for compressed air tanks and
his helmet the oxygen mask. He felt equally uncomfortable. Only the damned
flippers were missing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since his RX-10 G-suit was designed for high-altitude flight,
intended to do double-duty as an emergency backup in case of cockpit
decompression, he had to carry along his own personal environmental-control
unit, a white, battery-powered air conditioner the size of a large briefcase.
It hummed lightly as it cooled and dehumidified the interior of his suit,
keeping his faceplate moisture-free. The recycled air he was breathing smelled
stale and vaguely synthetic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The most uncomfortable part of all, however, not to mention
the most nerve-racking, had to be the six sticks of C-4 plastic explosive and
their radio-controlled detonators now secured against his chest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since the Soviet engineers had suited him up in a separate
room, avoiding any contact with the Mino Industries doctors who'd been giving
Androv his preflight physical, he'd yet to see Yuri Andreevich Androv clearly.
He had a partner and he hadn't even had a good look at him yet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The other M-I pilot will be arriving in a few
minutes,&quot; Androv was announcing to the white-jacketed Japanese technicians
standing by the Personnel Module. &quot;He was delayed in the briefing.&quot;
For their benefit he was speaking English, which, to Vance's surprise and relief,
was almost perfect. They nodded as he continued. &quot;We'll just go on up in
the module. I want to check over the cockpit one last time, make sure there're
no last-minute glitches.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Personnel Module resembled a small mobile home, except
its pneumatic lift could elevate it sixty feet straight into the air,
permitting direct access to the cockpit's side hatch. It was worlds away from
the fourteen-foot metal ladder used to access a MiG cockpit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Flight deck.&quot; He was speaking through his helmet
mike as he pointed up. &quot;Understand? Cockpit.&quot; Then he turned and
motioned for Vance to follow as he stepped in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hai</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.&quot;
Vance nodded gravely, Japanese style. &quot;<i>Wakarimasu</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Let's hope the haze keeps down visibility, he was
thinking. This place is sure to have video monitors everywhere. And this fancy
elevator is probably bugged too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Intelligence from Command Central was that Tanzan Mino's two
Yakuza &quot;pilots&quot; were receiving a last-minute briefing from the CEO
himself. Still, they were certain to show up soon. This was no time to dawdle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The technicians closed the door of the module, then activated
the lift controls. As it began gliding upward, Androv glanced over and gave
Vance a silent thumbs-up. He flashed it back, then set down the heavy
air-conditioning unit and shifted his weight from foot to foot, still trying to
get the feel of the suit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe, he told himself, this test pilot game is easier than
it looks. But only so long as you never actually have to leave terra firma.
Then it's probably more excitement than the average person needs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The upward motion halted with a lurch and the module door
automatically slid open. At first glance the open cockpit of the USSR's latest
plane made him think of the inside of a giant computer. Nothing like the
eye-soothing green of a MiG interior, it was a dull off-white in color and
cylindrical, about ten feet in diameter and sixteen feet long. Three futuristic
G-seats equally spaced down the center faced a bank of liquid crystal video
screens along one wall, and lighting was provided by pale orange sodium vapor
lamps integrated into the ceiling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The real action was clearly the middle G-seat, which was
surrounded by instrument consoles and situated beneath a huge suspended helmet,
white enamel and shaped like a bloated moth. Everything about the controls
bespoke advanced design philosophy: Instead of the usual flight stick placed
between the pilot's knees, it had a multiple-control sidestick, covered with
switches and buttons, situated on the pilot's right, something only recently
introduced in the ultramodern American F-16 Falcon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Although the throttle quadrant was still located on the
left-hand console, in standard fashion, it, too, had a grip skillfully designed
to incorporate crucial avionics: the multiple radars,
identification-friend-or-foe (IFF) instrumentation, instrument landing system
(ILS), and tactical air navigation (TACAN).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He realized they'd utilized the new Hotas concept—hands on
throttle and stick—that located all the important controls directly on the
throttle and flight stick, enabling the pilot to command the instruments and
flight systems purely by feel, like a virtuoso typist. Even the thin rudder
pedals looked futuristic. The whole layout, in severe blacks and grays, was
sleek as an arrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the end, however, maybe it was all redundant. According to
Andrei Androv this vehicle incorporated an advanced control system called <i>equipment
vocal pour aeronef</i>; it could be flown entirely by voice interface with an
artificial intelligence computer. All flight and avionics interrogations,
commands, and readouts could be handled verbally. You just talked to the damn
thing and it talked back. The twenty-first century had arrived.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The other two G-seats in the cockpit, intended for research
scientists, were positioned on either side of the pilot, about four feet away,
with no controls whatsoever. All this baby needed was Androv and his computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was more. The space was cylindrical, which could only
mean one thing: It was designed to be rotated, again probably by the computer,
adjusting the attitude or inclination of the pilot continuously to make sure
the G-forces of acceleration and deceleration would always be acting down on
him, like gravity, securing him into that special G-seat. And why not? Since
there was no windscreen, the direction the pilot faced was irrelevant—up, down,
or even backward; who cared?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And the helmet, that massive space-moth intended to be
lowered over the pilot's head. From the briefing, he knew that the screens
inside were how the pilot &quot;saw.&quot; Through voice command to the central
computer he could summon any of the three dozen video terminals along the walls
and project them on the liquid crystal displays before his eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So far, so good,&quot; Androv said, stepping in and
down. Vance followed, then reached back to secure the hatch. It closed with a
tight, reassuring thunk. The silent blinking of computer screens engulfed them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By the way, it's up there,&quot; Vance said quietly,
shifting his head toward the newly installed video camera positioned just above
the entry hatch. Androv glanced up, nodded, and together they turned away from
it. Then without further conversation they each ripped off their Velcro-secured
insignias—Androv's, the Soviet air force red star bordered in white; Vance's,
the double ax—and exchanged them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How much time?&quot; Androv whispered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just give me ten minutes.&quot; He held up his heavy
wrist-watch. Together they checked and synchronized.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good luck.&quot; Androv nodded and gave another thumbs-
up sign, then clasped him in an awkward Russian hug. Vance braced himself for
the traditional male kiss, but thankfully it didn't come. &quot;<i>Do svidania,
moi droog</i>,&quot; he said finally, standing back and saluting. Then he
grinned and continued in accented English, &quot;Everything will be
A-okay.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without another word he swung open the hatch, passed through,
and stepped into the personnel module.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance watched him depart, then turned back to examine the <i>Daedalus</i>
cockpit more closely. It was a bona fide marvel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Screens, banks of screens, all along the wall—almost
like a TV station's control room. Everything was there. Looking across, left to
right, he saw that the engine readouts were placed on top: white bars showing
power level, fan rpm, engine temperatures, core rpm, oil pressure, hydraulics,
complete power-plant status. The next row started on the navigation and
avionics: the radar altimeter, the airspeed indicator, the attitude-director
indicator (AID) for real-time readings of bank and dive angle, the horizontal
situation indicator (HSD) for actual heading and actual track, and on and on.
All the electronics modules were already operating in standby mode—the
slit-scan radar, the scanners, the high-resolution doppler. Other screens
showed the view of the hangar as seen by the video cameras on the landing gear,
now switched over from their infrared mode to visible light.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The avionics, all digital, were obviously keyed to the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>buttons and
switches on the sidestick, the throttles, and the two consoles. Those controls,
he realized upon closer inspection, could alter their function depending on
which display was being addressed, thereby reducing the clutter of separate
buttons and toggle switches on the handgrips.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The cockpit was not over-designed the way so many modern ones
tended to be: instead it had been entirely rethought. There were probably two
hundred separate system readouts and controls, but the pilot's interface was
simple and totally integrated. It was beautiful, a work of pure artistry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which made him sad. He'd always been an aviation buff, and
the thought of obliterating a creation this spectacular provoked a sigh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the other hand, H-bombs were probably beautiful too. This
was another vengeful Shiva, Destroyer of Worlds. Ridding the planet of its
first hypersonic weapons delivery system would be a public service to all humankind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But first things first. He had no intention of allowing his
next moves to be on TV. The newly installed monitor, part of the
&quot;retrofit,&quot; was about to get a small adjustment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Strolling back toward the entry hatch, he quickly detached
the reflecting outer visor that was designed to drop down over the front of his
flight helmet. Then he reached up and wedged the silvered portion against the
lens. The camera would continue to operate, relaying back no malfunction
signals, but it would be sending a picture of the ceiling. Next he unzipped his
flight suit and carefully unstrapped the package riding against his chest.
Inside were the six taffy-colored bars of C-4 plastic explosive, each an inch
square and six inches long, all wrapped in clear Cellophane. They almost looked
like candy, but they could blow this entire plane through the hangar's roof.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The charge had to be set before the two Mino-gumi pilots were
delivered by the Personnel Module. When they arrived, he'd simply pretend to be
Yuri Androv and say they all had to go back down for a final check of their
pressure-suit environmental systems. The moment they were clear, he'd activate
the radio and detonate. Then the fun would begin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There. The two consoles on either side of the central G-seat,
that's where he'd wedge the charges. It was the perfect place, the central
nervous system. After one last, wistful look at the banks of video displays
along the wall, he set to work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you understand?&quot; Tanzan Mino asked. It sounded
more like a command. They were in the Mino Industries Prep Section, a preflight
briefing room that led directly into the hangar. The faceplates of the two
pilots' flight helmets were raised, allowing him to see their eyes. &quot;Any
deviation from the prescribed maneuver blocks will signal a problem.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Hai</i>, Mino-sama,&quot; both men nodded grimly.
They had come here in the cockpit of his personal Boeing, and they were not
happy with their new assignment. Neither had the slightest desire to risk his
life in the service of the <i>oyabun s </i>megalomania. The command to serve as
last-minute &quot;co-pilots&quot; in the <i>Daedalus</i>, however, was an offer
they could not refuse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Should anything happen, you will radio Flight Control
immediately, and we will use the plane's artificial intelligence system, the AI
module, to bring it back and land it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Hai</i>.&quot; They nodded again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;You will not be expected to take the
controls,&quot; he went on. &quot;The computer can override all commands from
the cockpit. You will merely ensure the prescribed flight sequence is adhered
to.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He paused, intending to collect his thoughts, but an oddity
on the newly installed cockpit monitor caught his notice. He cursed himself for
not having kept an eye on it. He'd been too busy briefing the pilots and now .
. .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Something about the picture was strange. The perspective had
changed. He reached over and, with the push of a button, transferred the image
to the large liquid crystal screen on the side wall. Yes, it was definitely
wrong. He couldn't quite tell . . .  Had someone jostled the camera? There was
still a full half hour before . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Something had happened in the cockpit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The prep crews were scheduled to be finished by now—he
glanced at a screen and confirmed that the checklists had already been
punched—so no one had permission to be inside the plane. From this point on,
only the pilots were authorized to be there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Androv. Where was he? He was supposed to be in the Soviet
Flight-Prep Sector now, across the hangar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned to Taro Ikeda, who was monitoring a line of video
screens. &quot;Check with Flight Prep. Has the Soviet pilot completed his
preflight physical? Has it been signed off?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me see.&quot; He moved immediately to comply. After
he tapped a keyboard, a number matrix appeared on his computer screen, showing
the status of all the preflight sequences. Quickly he called up the pilot
sequence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His physical has been completed, Mino-sama. Everything
is checked off. He logged out fifteen minutes ago.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then where is he?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll try and find out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>He reached for a phone and punched in the main number
for the Flight Prep sector. The conversation that followed was quick and, as it
continued, caused a look of puzzlement to spread over his already-worried face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Hai, domo arigato gozaimashta</i>,&quot; he said
finally and hung up. As he turned back he was growing pale. &quot;Mino-sama, I
think there may be a problem. They say he has already left the sector,
but—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right then, where has he gone?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sector Security says he left with one of your pilots,
Mino-sama, headed for the hangar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room grew ominously silent. They were both now staring at
the two Mino Industries pilots, standing directly in front of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There must be some mistake.&quot; Tanzan Mino inhaled
lightly. &quot;Are you sure you understood correctly?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's obviously impossible. I agree.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then what's going on? Whatever it is, I think we'd
better find out. Immediately.&quot; He motioned for the two pilots to accompany
him as he rose and headed for the door. &quot;Stay close by. We're going to the
hangar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Taro Ikeda briskly followed after them into the corridor. If
anything went wrong now, he would be the one held responsible. Some vandal
tampering in the cockpit was the last thing he needed. Everything had gone
smoothly with the countdown so far this morning; he shuddered at the prospect
of a last-minute hold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Ahead of him, Tanzan Mino was striding down the hallway,
<i>kobun</i> bodyguards in tow, headed directly for the wide hangar doors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was still having trouble thinking clearly. Michael was in
the hangar, was actually in one of the planes. What was he doing here?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She barely noticed when a <i>kobun </i>walked in and settled
her suitcase on the metal desk. He glanced at it, said something in Japanese,
and disappeared out the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The case was heavy leather, acquired from a little side-street
shop by Victoria Station. It looked just as it had when she and Michael stashed
the Uzi back in London. They'd deliberately bought a case heavy enough to
conceal a weapon inside. Had Mino's people gone through it? Discovered the
automatic?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is this it?&quot; Vera was asking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the one.&quot; She reached down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No,&quot; Vera said, staying her hand, &quot;I will
open it myself.&quot; With a quick motion she pulled around the zipper, then
flipped back the heavy leather top. There lay a battered map of Crete, under it
Michael's book on the palace, piles of rumpled clothes . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This isn't how it's supposed to happen, she was thinking. The
automatic's down in the bottom, in a separate section, but if Vera probes a
little she'll find it. I've got to make her—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's no printout here.&quot; Comrade Karanova
finished</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>digging
through the clothes and looked up. &quot;But then there never really was, was
there, Dr. Borodin? Perhaps what you'd hoped to find was this . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She pulled open the top drawer of the metal desk and lifted
out a shiny black automatic. It was an Uzi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You didn't really think you could do something as amateurish
as smuggle a weapon into this facility.&quot; She shoved it back into the
drawer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Congratulations. You've done your homework.&quot; So
much for surprising Vera Karanova. Apparently that wasn't something easily
managed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now we will print a new copy of the protocol,&quot; she
said, shoving the suitcase over to one corner of her desk. &quot;I don't want
to waste any more time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right. Time is money.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So now it was up to Michael. Maybe if she could stall Vera
long enough, whatever he was involved in would start to happen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Glancing out again at the vapor-shrouded floor of the hangar,
she fleetingly wondered if maybe she'd been seeing things. No, she was certain.
That walk, that funny walk he always had when he didn't feel in control. She
knew it all too well; she knew him all too well. He'd arrived on the hangar
floor riding on that little motorized cart, together with the Soviet pilot, and
they'd both entered the hydraulic personnel carrier and been raised up to the
cockpit. Then the carrier had come back down and disgorged the Soviet pilot,
who'd immediately disappeared into the haze. Which meant Michael still had to
be up there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What was he doing? Had he somehow thrown in his lot with the
Soviets? He certainly wouldn't work for Tanzan Mino, so that meant there had to
be a revolt brewing. The thing now was to link up, join forces. It was hard to
figure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Oh, shit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Coming through the wide hangar doors, headed for the same
personnel transporter Vance had taken, was Tanzan Mino and a host of his <i>kobun</i>
bodyguards, followed by two more men in pressure suits. He looked as though he
had every intention of—yes, now he was saying something to the operators of the
personnel carrier. They all were going up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whatever Michael was doing, Mino-san wasn't going to be
pleased. The whole scene was about to get crazy. Did Mike have a weapon? Even
if he did, he wouldn't stand a chance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tanzan Mino was marching up the steps of the Personnel
Module, accompanied by six <i>kobun </i>in black leather jackets and the M-I
pilots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The operators glanced at each other, then moved to comply.
One Japanese pilot had just come down and disappeared into the haze. Now two
more had arrived, along with the CEO. Were there three Japanese pilots? Things
were starting to get peculiar. But then this was no ordinary flight; it was the
big one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The door clicked shut with a quiet, pneumatic whoosh, and the
module began its ascent. As they rode, Tanzan Mino reflected that in less than
an hour this vehicle would be setting new records for manned flight. The world
would hear about it from a press conference he would hold in Tokyo, carried
live around the globe. That press briefing would also announce a new alliance
between Japan and the Soviet Union. It would be a double coup. The planet's
geopolitics would never again be the same.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The module glided to a halt and its door opened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd been right. The cockpit hatch was sealed, which meant
somebody was inside. The Soviet pilot must be up to something. But what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then, unbidden, the pressure hatch started opening, slowly
swinging back and around, and standing there, just inside, was a man in a

face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance stared at the small army facing him, including Tanzan
Mino and his two pilots. This definitely was not the drill. Something had gone
very, very wrong. Had some of the Soviet ground crews lost their nerve and
talked? Whatever had happened, things were headed off the track.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The C-4 explosive was set. But this was hardly the moment to
activate the detonators and blow the place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How did you get here?&quot; The CEO's eyes narrowed to
slits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I decided to take you up on that tour.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you think you're doing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Planning a vacation. Checking out the
transportation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very amusing, Dr. Vance,&quot; he said, staring at a
length of C-4, a glass and metal detonator shoved into its side, wedged next to
the sidestick. &quot;But who else is part of your scheme? You didn't arrange
this unassisted.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why would anybody else be involved? I just thought it'd
be fun to kick off today's celebration with a bang.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm afraid you will have to be disappointed.&quot; He
turned to the <i>kobun</i>. &quot;Clear the cockpit. Sweep it. And then,&quot;
he glanced up, &quot;after Dr. Vance replaces the visor on his flight helmet,
we will escort him to my office for a very brief and undoubtedly very
illuminating interview.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's happening?&quot; Vera had turned to watch through
the white haze as the last <i>kobun </i>dismounted from the personnel module,
following Tanzan Mino and the three pilots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe there's been a glitch in the countdown after
all.&quot; Eva was trying to sound casual. Vera couldn't know the tall pilot in
the middle, the one being helped along by Tanzan Mino's musclemen, was Michael.
&quot;Looks like Major Androv has got himself into some trouble.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She could tell Vance was mad as hell. They'd probably roughed
him up a little there in the cockpit, just to get started, and now they were
intending to really go to work on him. But he must be part of a group, so where
was everybody else?</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Androv has to fly the plane today. We have
everything scheduled. Why are they taking him away?&quot; Vera turned and
stalked for the door. &quot;This cannot be permitted. Whatever the problem is,
it has to be solved right here. Now. The flight must go forward. Too much is
riding on it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Eva watched her stride out into the white haze of the hangar.
She wanted to follow, but then she thought of something better.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was wondering when to try and make a break. But how far
could he get, encumbered with the pressure suit?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Where's the backup? Are they going to let me just twist in
the wind?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The original scenario had fallen apart, but that didn't mean
the game was over. The Soviet engineers he'd seen clearly wouldn't be any help
in a crisis, but the test pilot Androv was another story. He'd surely try to
pull something back together. Where was he? Probably still up in the other
cockpit, getting <i>Daedalus II </i>ready. So now . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's when he saw her, coming out of an office whose doorway
was only half visible through the clouds of mist. It looked like . . . Vera
Karanova. She was striding directly toward them, intercepting Tanzan Mino's
small procession.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where are you taking him?&quot; She pointed toward
Vance, glancing at his Red Star insignia, as she addressed the godfather in
English.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you attempting to interfere in my affairs now,
too?&quot; Tanzan Mino demanded as he paused to stare.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I just want to know what it is you're doing,&quot; she
replied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I am handling a problem,&quot; he said coldly as he examined
her. &quot;There is a traitor, or traitors, among the Soviets. I intend to find
out who's involved.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; An edge of nervousness entered
her voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance was coming up. &quot;Sorry I screwed up, Vera,&quot; he
said in English. &quot;So close yet so far. Somebody must have blown the
whistle.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're not—&quot; She stared as he lifted the visor of
his flight helmet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But what the hell,&quot; he went on. &quot;We gave it a
shot. Nothing ventured, nothing—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We?&quot; She examined him, puzzled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I suspected all along you could not be trusted.&quot;
Tanzan Mino's calm facade seemed to crack as his face flushed with anger.
&quot;But I had no idea you would actually betray the entire project. Sabotage
the vehicle.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know anything about sabotage.&quot; She clearly
was startled, attempting to maintain calm in her voice. &quot;If Vance
has—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It appears I'm surrounded by treachery and
traitors.&quot; His voice quavered as he stepped over to one of the <i>kobun</i>,
then reached in and withdrew the 9mm Walther automatic from the man's shoulder
holster. When he turned back, his eyes were opaque with anger and paranoia.
He'd clearly snapped, lost it. &quot;Mr. Vance, I want to know the names of
everyone who was involved in this plot. Everyone. If I am satisfied you are
telling the truth, then perhaps I will consider sparing your miserable life.
Otherwise . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned back to Vera. She was staring at the gun, her face
ashen, not letting herself believe what her eyes were telling her. The white
mists of the hangar swirled around them, creating ghostly shadows across the
expressionless faces of the <i>kobun</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You made a very grave error in judgment,&quot; he was
saying to her. &quot;I don't yet know precisely what you were expecting to
accomplish, but whatever it was, I can assure you I am not a man who tolerates
disloyalty.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His expression was strangely distant as he raised the pistol
and fired, one precise round, a dull thunk barely audible above the din of the
hangar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance watched in dismay as Vera Karanova stumbled</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>backward,
her dark eyes uncomprehending. It was a gangland-style execution, quick and
preemptory, the time-honored way. No appeals or due process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd been hoping merely to gain some time for Androv, not
cause her to be murdered on the spot. Now Tanzan Mino turned to him, still
gripping the pistol. His face was distorted in irrational fury. &quot;Perhaps I
made a mistake just now, Dr. Vance. What do you think?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Probably a pretty serious one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, now that I reflect on it, I'm inclined to agree.
The culprit we seized red-handed was you. You are the one I should be making an
example of.&quot; He was raising the Walther again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It began so quickly he almost didn't realize it was happening.
From out of the swirl of mist that engulfed <i>Daedalus</i> /'s landing gear a
white-haired old man appeared, grasping a pistol. Tanzan Mino turned to stare,
just in time to hear him yelling—in Russian.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Release him. Release my son. I order you.&quot; He was
closing on the group, about twenty feet in front of them, brandishing the
weapon uncertainly. Vance couldn't make out what caliber it was, but he doubted
it mattered. Andrei Androv clearly had no idea how to use it. His was an act of
desperation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then another realization clicked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He said &quot;my son.&quot; He thinks I'm Yuri.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before anybody could move, a white pressure suit materialized
out of the distant haze around <i>Daedalus II</i>. It was Yuri Androv, running
toward his father, shouting. &quot;<i>Nyet</i>! Don't—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Release him, I tell you.&quot; Andrei Androv
didn't hear him as he continued to move menacingly on Tanzan Mino. The outcome
was inevitable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance ducked and rolled for the Personnel Module just as the <i>kobun's</i>
line of H&amp;K automatics flared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Andrei Androv lurched, gray hair flying, and managed to get
off two rounds. But instead of hitting a <i>kobun</i>, he caught one of the
Mino Industries pilots, visor up, directly in the face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Comrade Doktor Andrei Petrovich Androv, dean of Soviet
propulsion technology, chief designer of the <i>Daedalus</i>, died instantly,
his eyes still fixed in determination. However, Tanzan Mino's <i>kobun</i>
weren't tidy. One of them squeezed off a couple more rounds just as Yuri Androv
ran up and leaned over his father's crumpled body. With a groan, he spun around
and staggered against the huge 22-ply tires of <i>Daedalus </i>/'s starboard
landing gear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It still wasn't over. As Vance scrambled against the Personnel
Module, he caught a glimpse of something that, faintly visible through the
clouds of cryogenic fog, apparently was escaping everybody else. Another woman
was standing in the door of the office where Vera Karanova had been. Holding an
Uzi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How had she managed to get her hands on that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Not a second too soon. She can sweep the floor. Just get out
of the way and give her an opening. Maybe there's still time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He began scrambling for the base of the Personnel Module. Now
the white mist was obscuring everything, and Tanzan Mino seemed to have
enveloped himself in it. He was nowhere to be seen. However, his presence was
not missed by his <i>kobun</i>, who were still taking care of business.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The next agenda item, Vance realized, was himself. As he
tried to roll under the module, one was turning, raising his automatic . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Eva was yelling, &quot;Michael, stay down.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The <i>kobun</i> all whirled back, but she was ready. Stock
extended, full auto.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jesus, he thought, that hood in the back is holding enough
C-4 to clear a small arena. If she hits one of the detonators . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was either a lucky or an unlucky shot. After eight rounds,
less than a second's worth, a blinding ball of fire erupted where the <i>kobun</i>
had been, sending a shock wave rolling through the open space of the hangar,
knocking over technicians almost a hundred feet away. As Vance was slammed
under the Personnel Module, out of the corner of his eye he saw Eva being
thrown against the doorframe of the office. The air blossomed with the smell of
deadly C-4, like acrid Sterno. Not for nothing did the U.S. military swear by
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Yuri Androv was peeling himself off <i>Daedalus II’s </i>landing
gear, his flight suit blackened and smudged. Blood from a bullet wound was
running down the right sleeve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They'll be coming for us all, Vance thought. Tanzan Mino's
probably somewhere radioing for more guards right now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Eva was stalking through the smoke, still grasping the Uzi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, are you all right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hell of a morning.&quot; He was pulling himself out
from under the Personnel Module, awkwardly trying to straighten his flight
helmet. &quot;You took out the palace guard, everybody but Mr. Big.
Congratulations. And I thought CIA had a patent on that kind of
operation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Already emergency alarms had begun a high-pitched whine,
blaring through the cavernous hangar. Everything around them was chaos.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know,&quot; she yelled above the noise, &quot;he's
going to kill us immediately. There's no way he's going to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I figure we've got about two minutes to think of something,&quot;
he yelled back and pointed. &quot;Check on the pilot. His name is Androv.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know. I met him last night.&quot; She turned and
stared. &quot;We had a small misunderstanding.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, let's see if he's still in any condition to
fly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How else? You got any better ideas, I'd like to hear
them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yuri Androv had worked his way through the carnage of the
explosion, the scattered remains of Tanzan Mino's phalanx of <i>kobun</i>, to
again bend over the form of his father. Once more the cloud of obscuring mist
was flowing over the scene, blanking it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment, however, a pale glow laid itself around them,
the murky light of overcast dawn. Vance realized the Soviet technicians had
thrown open the hangar doors and were scrambling out onto the tarmac.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good, let them. We might just follow suit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Yuri Andreevich Androv was approaching, clasping his
right arm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We've got to get him fixed,&quot; Vance said briskly,
looking him over, &quot;put on a tourniquet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Think he can still fly?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I say we make him fly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With his left hand Androv peeled back his helmet visor and
kissed Eva. &quot;<i>Spacebo</i>,&quot; he said in Russian, &quot;you did what
I would have done if I'd had a weapon. But now I don't know what—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How's your arm?&quot; Vance cut in. &quot;We've got to
make a decision right now. When the reinforcements arrive, it's game over. One
little Uzi won't handle their firepower.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Androv frowned. &quot;Can you fly?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Never handled anything bigger than a Lear,&quot; Vance
replied. &quot;And then only as copilot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It didn't seem to matter. Androv glanced at the open door of
the Personnel Module and motioned to them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then come on. Let's hurry.&quot; Now he was searching
the hangar. Finally he spotted the man he wanted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Pavel,&quot; he yelled in Russian, &quot;have the
starter trolleys been engaged yet?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Da</i>,&quot; came the reply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then prepare <i>Daedalus I </i>for power-up and get the
hell out. We're go for rpm.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean? The tow trucks haven't even
been—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Forget the tow trucks. It's going to be afterburners,
right here. Get the rest of your people in the clear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Afterburners were rings of nozzles that sprayed fuel into the
superheated exhaust gases of a jet engine, creating a burst of power. In
military aircraft they were used to produce surges in thrust during takeoff and

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Afterburners! In the hangar. Yuri, all the hydrogen
storage tanks could blow. You'd destroy<i> Daedalus II</i>. Just incinerate
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>&quot;That's the idea.&quot; He was already
mounting the steps of the Personnel Module, not looking back. &quot;There's
only going to be one plane left. The one I take.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The computer.&quot; Eva had started up the steps, but
then she froze and turned back, handing Vance the Uzi. &quot;I have to get
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;There's no time.&quot; He reached for the
weapon, its muzzle still hot. &quot;We've got—&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael, I didn't come this far just to let the
protocol slip through our fingers.&quot; She was running past him now, back
down. &quot;Only take a second.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He knew it was pointless to argue. And besides, maybe she was
right. Who knew where they'd end up?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Androv had faltered and was leaning shakily against the
open doorway of the module, the right sleeve of his pressure suit covered in
blood. Vance took advantage of the ticking moments to step up and examine it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You need a bandage.&quot; He started tearing away the
synthetic cloth. &quot;Or better yet, a tourniquet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No.&quot; Androv glanced at his arm and grimaced.
&quot;There's not—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're going on adrenaline right now, my friend. But
when the shock wears off . . .&quot; He looked around the interior of the
module, but there was nothing to cut with, so he just ripped away a large
portion of Androv's sleeve and parted the material. A savage furrow was sliced
across his bicep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't want you to pass out.&quot; He tore a section
of the sleeve into a strip and then, struggling with his heavy gloves, began binding
it above the wound. The hangar was still bedlam, people running and yelling on
every side, alarms sounding. As he was finishing the tourniquet, Eva came
bounding up the metal steps carrying her Zenith. They were ready.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Androv quickly secured the door and activated the controls.
Through a smoke-smeared window they watched the bloody hangar floor disappear
into the haze. The world suddenly turned dreamlike, an unreality highlighted by
the soft whoosh of the pneumatic lift beneath them. Then the module lurched to
a halt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance led the way through the open hatch. &quot;Looks like
somebody forgot and left the lights on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Pavel told me the starter trolleys were
engaged,&quot; Androv said in Russian as he climbed through, then stepped down.
He continued in English. &quot;Petra can initiate power-up.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Petra?&quot; Vance turned back. &quot;You mean
the—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Our copilot.&quot; He pointed toward a large liquid
crystal screen at the far end of the cabin, now blank. &quot;I want to try and
use her to override Flight Control for the rest of the sequence.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Short circuit the countdown?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've never done it, but . . .&quot; He walked over and
reached down to flip a square blue switch on the right-hand console.
&quot;Let's see if she's awake this morning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He glanced up as the screen blinked on and a large black-and-white
double-ax logo materialized, set against the red and white of a Japanese flag.
Next he pushed a button on the sidestick and spoke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Petra, report countdown status.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>“<i>All preflight sequences nominal.” </i>The eerie,
mechanical sound of a woman's voice, speaking Russian, filled the space. “<i>Do
you acknowledge?</i>”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>&quot;Affirmative,&quot; he answered back.
&quot;You will now initiate ignition sequence. Bypass remaining countdown procedure.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>“<i>That is an override command. Please give authorization
code.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Code P-18. Systems emergency.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>“<i>The countdown is now T minus nineteen minutes
twenty-eight seconds. All systems are nominal. Therefore Code P-18 is not a
valid command.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>&quot;Shit,&quot; he whispered under his breath.
&quot;Petra, verify P-18 with Flight Control.&quot; He paused for a split
second, then pushed a button on the console and commanded, &quot;Abort
instruction.&quot; Another pause, then, &quot;Repeat verify abort command for N
equals one over zero.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What was that?&quot; Eva was wedging her laptop under
the left-hand G-seat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think, I hope I just put her command-monitor function
into an infinite loop. She'll just continuously start and stop the verification
procedure. Maybe it'll render that subroutine incapable of blocking the other
system functions.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're going to confuse her head? Good luck.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He settled himself in the central seat, then reached up and
began unlatching the huge flight helmet. As he did, his eyes were suddenly
flooded with grief.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They killed him.&quot; He paused for a moment and just
stared. Vance thought he'd finally become befuddled from the shock. But then he
choked back his emotion and continued. &quot;We're going on the deck. Under
their goddam radar.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What did you say?&quot; Vance strained to catch his
words. The English was slurred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He seemed to grow faint, his consciousness wane, but he
finally revived as he finished yanking the giant helmet down over his head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance's headphones came alive as he heard the Russian. &quot;<i>Daedalus
I</i> to Control. Do you read? I am now bringing up core rpm for starboard
cluster, outboard trident.&quot; A second later, he continued, &quot;We have
S-O ignition.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yuri,&quot; came a startled radio voice, &quot;what in

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Portside cluster, outboard. Rpm up,&quot; he continued
in Russian, his voice halting. &quot;We have P-O ignition.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sergei, I told them to clear the hangar. I'm taking her
to full power.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The liquid hydrogen tanks are in there. You could blow
the whole hangar to hell if you use afterburners. You must be crazy!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The bastards gunned him down, Sergei.&quot; He caught a
sob. &quot;It was my fault. I should have warned—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you talking about? Gunned who down?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But Yuri Androv's mind was already elsewhere, drifting into a
grief-obsessed dream state.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Engine start complete,&quot; he continued.
&quot;Beginning pre-takeoff sequence.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Will he be able to get this thing off the ground? Vance was
wondering. He's shot up and now he's falling apart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Guess we're about to find out. The fuselage cameras are
showing an empty hangar. Everybody's run for cover.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Eva, want to take that seat? I'll take this one. No
free drinks in this forward cabin section.&quot; He was speaking through his
upraised helmet visor as he eased himself into the right-hand G-seat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And buckle up for safety.&quot; She settled herself in
the left. &quot;Let's just hope he can still manage this monster. It's a Saturn
V with wings.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's got his talking computer, if she'll still
cooperate. Do me a favor and translate now and then.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Machines are supposed to translate for people, not the
other way around. We're in space warp.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I believe it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he pulled down the overhead seat straps, he found himself
wondering what <i>Daedalus </i>would feel like in full afterburner mode. Those
turboramjets made a Boeing 747's massive JT-9Ds look like prime movers for a medium-sized
lawnmower.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Power to military thrust.&quot; Androv was easing
forward the twin throttles, spooling them up past three-quarters power. <i>Daedalus
</i>had begun to quiver, shaking like a mighty mountain in tectonic upheaval.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Prepare for brake release.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The screens on the wall above reported fuel consumption
edging toward three hundred pounds of JP-7 a second.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yuri,&quot; the radio crackled, &quot;don't—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Pavel's got his men out of the hangar, Sergei. I can see
on my screen. I'm going cold mike now. No distractions. Just wish me
luck.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a click as he switched off the communications in
his helmet. He missed a new radio voice by only a second. It was speaking in
English.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Vance, what is going on? He's just cut his radio
link with Flight Control. He's deranged. I order you to halt the flight
sequence. He could destroy both planes by going to afterburners in the hangar.
I demand this be stopped.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance glanced up at the TV monitors. An auxiliary screen
showed Tanzan Mino standing at the main Flight Control console, surrounded by
more<i> kobun</i>, who had muscled aside the Russian technicians. He also
noticed that a lot of Soviet brass were there too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Looks like you've got a problem.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm warning you I will shut you down. I can activate
the automatic AI override three minutes after takeoff. The plane will return
and land automatically.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Three minutes is a long time.&quot; Vance wondered if
it was true, or a bluff. &quot;We'll take our chances.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'd leave me no choice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May the best man win.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Petra, brake release.&quot; Yuri Androv's voice sounded
from beneath his helmet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>“Acknowledged</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>Vance looked across to see his left hand signal a
thumbs-up sign, then reach down for the throttle quadrant. The vehicle was
already rolling through the wide doors of the hangar, so if there were an
explosion now, at least they'd be in the clear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Androv paused a second, mumbled something in Russian, then
shoved the heavy handles forward to Lock, commanding all twelve engines to max
afterburner. The JP-7 fuel reading whirled from a feed of three hundred pounds
a second to twenty-one hundred, and an instant thereafter the cockpit was
slammed by the hammer of God as the monitor image of the hangar dissolved in
orange.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance felt his lungs curve around his backbone, his face melt
into his skull. He didn't know how many G's of acceleration they were
experiencing, but it felt like a shuttle launch. He gripped the straps of the
G-seat and watched the video feed from the landing-gear cameras, which showed
the tarmac flashing by in a stream of gray. The screen above him had clicked up
to 200 knots, and in what seemed only a second the <i>Daedalus </i>was a full
kilometer down the runway. Then the monitors confirmed they were rotating to
takeoff attitude, seven degrees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>They were airborne.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next the screens reported a hard right-hand bank, five G's.
The altimeter had become a whirling blur as attitude increased to twenty degrees,
held just below stall-out by Petra's augmented control system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When the airspeed captured 400 knots, the landing gear
cameras showed the wheels begin to fold forward, then rotate to lie flat in the
fuselage. Next the doors snapped closed behind them, swallowing them in the
underbelly and leaving the nose cameras as their only visual link to the
outside. The screens displayed nothing but gray storm clouds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Landing gear up and locked, came Petra's disembodied voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

flashing message on one of the screens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No abort so far, Vance thought. Maybe we're about to get away
with this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The airspeed had already passed 600 knots, accelerating a
tenth of a Mach number, about 60 knots, every five seconds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's when he noticed they were still receiving wideband
video transmissions from the Flight Center. The screen showing Tanzan Mino
remained clear and crisp. Surely not for much longer, but now at least the
uplink was intact. And the CEO was returning the favor, monitoring their
lift-off via a screen of his own. Vance watched as he turned to some of the
Soviet brass standing next to him and barked orders. What was that about?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For now though the bigger question was, What do we do?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Androv was still busy talking to Petra, issuing commands.
Vance realized they were assuming a vector north by northeast, out over the
ocean. They also were probably going to stay on the deck to avoid radar
tracking, with only passive systems so that no EM emissions would betray their
heading.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He glanced up at the screens and realized he was half right.
They were over the ocean now, at a breathtaking altitude of only five hundred
meters, but Androv had just switched the phased-array radar altimeter over to
start hopping frequencies, using &quot;squirt&quot; emissions. Pure Stealth
technology. No conventional radar lock could track it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Vance, I am giving you one more opportunity to
reconsider.&quot; Tanzan Mino's voice sounded through the headphones. He was
still standing at the main Flight Control console, though his image was finally
starting to roll and break up. &quot;You must return to base. The consequences
of this folly could well be incalculable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why don't you take that up with the pilot?&quot; Vance
answered into his helmet mike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His receiver has been turned off. It's impossible to
communicate with him. He's clearly gone mad. I will give you another sixty
seconds before I order the on-board guidance computer switched over to the AI
mode. Flight Control here will override the on-board systems and just bring the
vehicle back and land it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Again Vance wondered if he really could.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then a screen flashed, an emergency strobe, and Petra was
speaking. The Russian was simple enough he could decipher it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Systems advisory. You are too low. Pull up. Acknowledge. Pull
up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Androv tapped the sidestick lightly and boosted their
altitude a hundred meters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Michael,&quot; the voice was Eva's coming through his
headphones. &quot;She—it—whoever, said—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I figured it out. But did you hear the other news?
Mino-san just advised he's going to override Petra. We're about to find out
who's really flying this baby.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No.&quot; Androv was raising his flight helmet and gesturing,
his wounded arm urging at something in his right pocket. &quot;Please take. Do
it quickly. And then . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance unstrapped his G-seat harness, rose, and moved over to
the central console. Androv had raised his hydraulic helmet all the way up now
and was trying to unzip the right side of his flight suit. Vance reached down
and helped him, not sure exactly what he needed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There.&quot; Yuri was trying to point. &quot;The radio.
Please, you must . . .&quot; The English began to fail him again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's this?&quot; Vance took out the transmitter, the
size and shape of a small calculator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The answer was in Russian, complex and garbled. Something about 
computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's wired something into the on-board computer, Michael,&quot;
Eva began translating. &quot;The radio will perform brain surgery on Petra,
disabling her AI functions. It's supposed to prevent Flight Control from
overriding . . . I didn't quite get it. But he wants you to help.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance glanced up at the line of video screens. <i>Daedalus </i>was
now skimming rapidly over the straits, banking in the direction of the
archipelago known as the Kurile Islands, and the image of Tanzan Mino was
breaking up, almost gone. Had he heard? Maybe it didn't matter. The allotted
sixty seconds was ticking away and he could just make out the image of Tanzan
Mino, holding a microphone, preparing to give orders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By the clock on the screens he saw that forty-one seconds had
already passed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Vance, we are preparing to initiate total systems
override.&quot; The CEO's voice sounded through his headphones. &quot;You have
fifteen seconds remaining to acknowledge.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The code,&quot; Androv was saying. &quot;It is
one-nine-nine-nine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance stared at the small device in his flight glove. It had
a number keypad and a liquid crystal display.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You have ten seconds,&quot; Tanzan Mino said. The image
was ghostly, but the voice still rang loud and clear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He began fumbling with the device, but the numbers kept eluding
him, slipping around the thick fingers of his gloves. Finally he caught the 1.
Above him the screens were still scrolling. Eight seconds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Suddenly the cockpit seemed to sway, an air pocket that</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>even the <i>Daedalus'</i>
advanced structural mode control system couldn't damp out entirely. Now Androv
was talking to Petra, going for a sliver more altitude. Seven seconds. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;Michael.&quot; Eva was watching, her face still drawn from the
acceleration. &quot;Is it—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's the gloves. The damned gloves. I'm . . .&quot; Then
he punched in the first 9.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the back of his mind he noted that the cockpit was
adjusting as <i>Daedalus </i>rotated, increasing attitude . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He got another 9. But his grip on the &quot;calculator&quot;
was slipping, pressing toward the floor as the G-forces of acceleration weighed
against him. He checked the screens again and saw that three seconds remained.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Androv was grappling to keep control of the throttle,
while issuing instructions to Petra.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Am I about to disable her? he wondered. If I do, can he
manage this nightmare manually? What if Mino was only bluffing?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Two seconds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A final, bright green 9 appeared on the liquid crystal
readout.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>“<i>Alert. AI system malfunction</i>.” It was the toneless
voice of Petra. She sounded vaguely annoyed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Something had happened. Two of the screens on the wall above
had just gone blank, but <i>Daedalus </i>continued to climb.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>&quot;Dr. Vance, we are now going to recall the
plane. We have ordered a wing of fighter-interceptors scrambled from the
Dolinsk airbase on Sakhalin. They will escort you back.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whoops. So that was what he was telling the Soviet brass to
do. Get up some hardware fast. This could well be the shortest flight since the
Wright brothers'.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he heard Androv's helmet mike click on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is <i>Daedalus I</i>. Do you copy me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>&quot;Major, you—&quot; Mino began.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Copy this, you bastard. Fuck you. Repeat. Fuck you.
I've disabled your fucking AI module.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You disabled it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's a roger. Do you read me, you murdering
son-of-a-bitch? FUCK YOU!&quot; He clicked off his mike</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance was moving slowly across the cockpit, headed back to
his own G-seat. As he settled himself and reached for the straps, he glanced up
at the screens to check their flight data—altitude, speed, vector, G-force,
fuel consumption. They were still on the deck, with an airspeed just under a
thousand knots, about eleven hundred miles per hour. Not quite Mach 2, but
already it was risky. And their vector was 085, with coordinates of 46 degrees
latitude, 143 degrees longitude.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What now? <i>Daedalus</i> had all the active radar systems
known to modern avionics. Looking at the screens he saw forward-looking radar,
sideways-looking radar, a four-beam multimode pulse-Doppler look-down radar,
terrain-following radar, radar altimeter, mapping and navigational radar, and a
host of high-powered ECM jammers. The problem was, they all emitted EM,
electromagnetic radiation. Switch on any of those and they'd become a flying
radio beacon, broadcasting their position.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The next row of screens, however, provided readouts
of their passive, non-emitting receivers and analyzers. That clearly was what
they would have to use to monitor the threat from Sakhalin, scooping up any EM
for lightning-fast computer processing. Surely Petra could spit out a
fingerprint of everything in the skies. To begin with, there were the basic
Radar Warning Receivers (RWRs) located aft, on the tailplanes, as well as
infrared warning receivers (IRWRs) positioned high on the outboard stabilizers.
The screens showed she could analyze basic frequency, operating mode, pulse
repetition frequency, amplitude of pulse, time of arrival, direction of
arrival—the full menu.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If it's true they've scrambled the base at Dolinsk, it
probably means the new MiG 31s.&quot; Androv was now busy switching on all the
passive systems, just the way Vance figured he would. &quot;We have to decide
what to do. But first I want to take her up and do a quick recon. Buckle
in.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The latest Foxhound has a multimode pulse-Doppler
look-down, shoot-down capability that's as good as any in the world,&quot;
Vance heard himself saying. &quot;We're the biggest target in the skies, and
we're unarmed. We'd be a sitting duck for one of their AA-9 active homing
missiles. They're launch-and-leave.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let's check it out before we get too worried,&quot;
Androv replied. &quot;But this has to be fast. You're about to see a Mach 3
Immelmann. Don't try this in a 747.&quot; He laughed, then began lowering his
high-tech helmet. &quot;I hope I can still manage it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a surge of acceleration as he shoved forward the
throttles, then yanked back on the sidestick. The Daedalus seemed to kick
straight up. And up. And up. The instruments showed they were traveling skyward
in a thin arc, as though sliding up the curve of an archer's bow. Now the
altimeter was spinning, and in eighteen seconds they had already reached twenty
thousand feet. But still Androv kept the stick in, and during the next five
seconds, as Daedalus continued tracing the archer's curve, they almost began to
fly upside down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At the last moment he performed an aileron half-roll and
righted them. The Immelmann had, in effect, taken them straight up and headed
their powerful forward-looking IR detectors and radar in the direction of
Sakhalin. Vance glanced at the screens and realized they'd climbed thirty
thousand feet in twenty-seven seconds. They'd just waxed the standing
forty-eight-second time-to-climb record of the USAF F-15 Eagle, and Daedalus
wasn't even breathing hard. Even though Androv had now chopped the power, they
still were cruising at Mach 2. Effortlessly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No wonder he loves this bird.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The only downside was, the fuel reading showed they'd burned
twenty-three thousand pounds of JP-7 during the climb out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Petra,&quot; Androv said into his helmet mike,
&quot;take VSD to standby and give me infrared laser.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Petra's interrogation revealed a wing of eight MiG 31
interceptors, flying in formation at twenty-five thousand feet and closing. At
Mach 2.4.</span></p>

Vance observed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

&quot;The hostile radar signature of this fuselage is almost nothing. And we
can defeat their infrared by taking her back on the deck, so the engines are
masked from their look-down IR. Back we go. We'll pull out at five hundred
meters, but it'll mean about three negative G's—blood to the brain, a redout.
Very dangerous. Be ready.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he shoved the sidestick forward and Daedalus plunged
into a Mach 3 power dive. The infrared cameras showed the sea plunging toward
them. The dive took even less time than the climb, with the altimeter
scrolling. Suddenly the voice of Petra sounded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>“Pull up. Warning. Pull up. Pilot must acknowledge

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He has disappeared from the Katsura radar again,
Mino-sama. I think he has taken the vehicle back on the deck.&quot; Ikeda's
face was ashen as he typed in the computer AI override command one last time,
still hoping. The Flight Control operations screen above him was reading
&quot;System Malfunction,&quot; while the engineers standing behind were
exchanging worried glances. Who was going to be held responsible? The master screen
above, the one with the Katsura radar, no longer showed the <i>Daedalus</i>.
Androv had taken it to thirty thousand feet, then down again. He was playing
games.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tanzan Mino was not wasting time marveling at the plane's
performance specs. He turned and nodded to General Sokolov, who was holding a
red phone in his hand. The MiG 31 wing wasn't flying military power; it was
full afterburners, which was pushing them to Mach 2.4. If Daedalus stayed on
the deck, they might still intercept.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We have no choice,&quot; he said in Russian.
&quot;Order them to give him a chance to turn back, and tell him if he refuses,
they will shoot him down. Maybe the threat will be enough.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sokolov nodded gravely. But what if Androv was as insane as
every indication suggested he was? What if he disobeyed the commands from the
Sakhalin interceptors? What then? Who was going to give the command that
unleashed AAMs to bring down the most magnificient airplane—make that
spacecraft—the world had ever seen. The MiG 31, with its long-range Acrid AA-9
missiles, had a stand-off kill capability that matched the American F-14 Tomcat
and its deadly AIM-54 Phoenix. Since the AA-9 had its own guidance system, the
pilot need not even see his target. One of those could easily bring down an unarmed
behemoth like the Daedalus as long as it was still in the supersonic mode,
which it would have to be at that low altitude.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A pall of sadness entered his voice as he issued the command.
Androv, of all people, knew the look-down shoot-down capabilities of the MiG 31.
Maybe there was still a chance to reason with him. The <i>Daedalus </i>had no
pilot-ejection capability. His choice was to obey or die.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Reports from the hangar said he'd taken some
automatic-weapons fire from the CEO's bodyguards. How badly wounded was he?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hard to tell, but he'd got <i>Daedalus</i> off the runway,
then done an Immelmann to take her to ten thousand meters, followed by a power
dive back to the deck. He was frolicking like a drunken dolphin. Pure Androv.
How much longer could he last?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sokolov glanced at the screen in front of him. The computer
was extrapolating, telling him that a due-east heading by <i>Daedalus</i> would
soon take her over international waters. If Androv kept that vector, at least
there'd be no messy questions about violating foreign airspace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How long before they can intercept?&quot; Tanzan Mino
asked, not taking his eyes from the screens. Now the Soviet interceptors were
on the Katsura radar, speeding toward <i>Daedalus'</i> last known vector

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In five minutes they will be within air-to-air
range,&quot; Sokolov replied. He paused, then asked the question weighing on
his mind. &quot;If he refuses to turn back, do you really want that vehicle
blown from the skies?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Tanzan Mino was thinking about the Stealth capabilities
of the <i>Daedalus</i>. Was the design good enough to defeat the MiG-31s'
pulse-Doppler radar? He suddenly found himself wishing the plane hadn't been so
well designed. The stupid Soviets, of course, had no idea—yet— that it could
just disappear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He could be headed for Alaskan air space. That's what
the computer is projecting. You understand the ramifications if this vehicle
falls into the hands of the Americans.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Soviet nodded gravely. That was, of course, unthinkable.
There would be no going home again.</span></p>

Breathe.&quot; She was pushing the button that raised the huge flight helmet.
As she watched, his open eyes gradually resumed their focus. Then he snapped
his head and looked around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Shto</i> . . . what happened?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't think you can handle heavy G-loads. You're weak
from the wound, the tourniquet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He straightened up, then glanced again at the altimeter. They
were cruising at three hundred meters, smooth as silk. And they were burning
six hundred pounds of JP-7 a second.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing has gone the way I planned.&quot; He rubbed at
his temples, trying to clear the blood from his brain. &quot;We're just buying
a little breathing space now by staying down here. I think the radar noise of
the choppy sea, together with all our Stealth capability, will keep us safe.
But at this low altitude we're using fuel almost as though we were dumping it.
If we continue to hold on the deck, we've got maybe half an hour's flying time
left.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If we gained altitude,&quot; Vance wondered,
&quot;could we stretch it enough to make Alaska?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Probably,&quot; Androv replied. &quot;If we took her
above fifty thousand feet, we might have a chance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then we've got no choice. The only solid ground between
here and the U.S. is the Kurile Islands, and they're Soviet territory.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But if we did reach U.S. airspace, then what?&quot; Eva
asked. &quot;We'd have to identify ourselves. Who's going to believe our story?
Nobody even knows this monster exists.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right,&quot; he laughed. &quot;A top-secret Soviet
hypersonic bomber comes cruising across the Bering Strait at sixty thousand
feet and into the USAF's airspace. One hint of this thing and they'd roll out
the SAMs.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe we couid talk our way down.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's no other choice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You are getting ahead of things, both of you,&quot;
Androv interrupted, staring at the screens on the wall. &quot;We still have to
handle the interceptors from Dolinsk. If we went for altitude, we'd show enough
infrared signature to make us an easy target during ascent. Before we even
reached two thousand meters, they'd have a lock on us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance glanced at the IRWR. Daedalus's infrared laser scanners
were still tracking the wing of MiG interceptors, now at twenty-two thousand
feet and closing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It doesn't matter,&quot; he said. &quot;We've got to
get off the deck soon, while we still have fuel. Either that or we'll have to
ditch at sea.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Comrade Vance, the Daedalus is a marvelous platform,
but when we go for altitude, we're going to be vulnerable. There's no getting
around it. This vehicle was intended to perform best at the edge of space, not
down here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;Then why not
take her there? Use the scramjets. We may be running out of JP-7, but we have a
load of liquid hydrogen. Maybe this is the moment to finally find out if this
thing can burn it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm—I'm afraid. After what happened when we pulled out
of the power dive, I'm not sure I could handle the G-load necessary to power in
the scramjets.&quot; Yuri paused. &quot;The tourniquet has almost paralyzed my
arm. I don't have the kind of control and timing we'd need. If I thought I
could—but no. I hate to say it, even think it, but maybe we have no choice but
to give up and turn back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not yet,&quot; Vance said. &quot;Maybe there's one
other possibility.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

said grimly. &quot;We don't know their exact vector, but they will have to gain
altitude soon. When they do . . .&quot; He turned to General Sokolov.
&quot;Radio Dolinsk and confirm the order.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was the moment Valentin Sokolov had been dreading. The
AA-9 missile, which was carried on the MiG 31’s recessed underfuselage
stations, came in two versions: the active radar homing model and the
heat-seeking infrared design. He suspected that <i>Daedalus </i>had enough
Stealth and ECM capabilities to partially defeat radar, but Stealth couldn't
mask IR.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sooner or later, Androv would have to make his move, come off
the deck. And when he did, the MiGs would pick him up and it would be over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But that was still preferable to letting Daedalus fall into
the hands of the Americans. So if Androv refused to answer his radio and comply
with the call-back, there'd be no choice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Androv asked, wiping
at his brow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance took a deep breath. &quot;We've got no choice. You know
what I'm thinking.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We'll need ten G's of acceleration to power in the
scramjets, my friend.&quot; He leaned back in the seat and closed his eyes. His
face was now drawn with pain, but the bleeding had stopped. Above them, Petra
silently flew the plane and flashed messages on the screens. &quot;I've trained
for years,&quot; he continued finally. &quot;Even with your inflatable G-suit,
you couldn't possibly take the G-loads and stay conscious.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What other choice is there? Either I try, or we ditch
down there in the Sea of Okhotsk. Personally, I'd rather go out like a shooting
star, taking our chances.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's not that simple. The scramjets are designed to be
powered in at Mach 4.8. We dare not risk that below at least forty thousand
feet. There are aerodynamic reasons. In fact, they're not really intended to be
used below sixty thousand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well,&quot; Vance said, &quot;if we started our ascent
at max throttle, what kind of airspeed could we capture by forty thousand?
Could we achieve Mach 4.8?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Only if we used afterburners. Which means we'd probably
have only about ten minutes of JP-7 left for landing later.&quot; He laughed
sadly. &quot;Assuming there's anywhere we could land.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How about Heathrow? I know a Japanese banker who'd
probably love to have this vehicle as collateral for a few billion in
Eurodollar debentures he's being forced to underwrite. He's a friend of mine
and I owe him a favor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You want to turn this plane over to some banker?&quot;
He was visibly startled. &quot;We can't ignore the fact that it still belongs,
technically, to Mino Industries.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My friend's a big boy. He'll work it out, Yakuza-style.
Don't worry.&quot; He glanced up at the fuel gauges. They now had twenty
minutes left. Just enough to get back to the facility and give up? Or go all
the way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Eva, what do you say. Want to give it a shot?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm game. One thing's for sure; I have no intention of
going back to get ourselves murdered by Tanzan Mino. If we can make it to the
other side of the world by burning hydrogen, then . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe, just maybe Petra could help enough for you to
manage it.&quot; Androv paused to collect his strength. &quot;I don't know if
you can stay conscious through the ten G's of acceleration needed to initiate
the scramjets. But I know for sure I can't, not in my current state. You might
as well give it a try.&quot; He turned to Eva and continued in Russian.
&quot;There's an emergency back-up pressure suit in that locker beneath Petra's
main screen. See if you can put it on. You'll still probably pass out, but
don't worry, the 'event' is only temporary. After we go through the hypersonic
barrier, acceleration will subside. Down to three, maybe four G's.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll get the suit,&quot; she said, starting to unbuckle
her straps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, we'd better get started.&quot; Vance was crossing
the cabin. The nose cameras were showing the spray of white- caps directly
below them. If they'd passed any fishing vessels, he mused, there were probably
stories of flying saucers already going around. The passive IRWR scanner was
still tracking the wing of MiG 31s, now at a hundred and thirty kilometers,
approximately eighty miles, and closing. Daedalus was almost within the kill
perimeter of the MiG 31s and their AA-9 missiles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The radio crackled, something in Russian. Yuri Androv stared
at the flight helmet, then looked down at the console and flipped a switch.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I copy you, Firefight One,&quot; he replied in Russian.
&quot;Over.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Androv, you idiot. What in hell are you doing? Defecting
to the capitalists?&quot; The voice laughed. &quot;We don't know what the devil
you're flying, but when you pulled that Immelmann, my IR thought you were an
An-124 Condor transport turned into a high-performance Foxbat. One incredible
son-of-a-bitch.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's a spaceship, Arkadi. Excuse me, Colonel Arkadi.
Congratulations on the promotion.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Spacebo</i>,&quot; he said, laughing again. Then he
sobered. &quot;Yuri, I don't know what this is all about, but I'm instructed by
General Sokolov to escort you and that thing you're flying back to Hokkaido. If
you're stupid enough to refuse, then I have orders to shoot you down.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is that any way to treat an old friend?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yuri Andreevich, we go back a long way. To the
Ramenskoye Flight Test Center. You were the best we ever had. Don't make me do
this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

give it your best.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Pull up. Show yourself on IR. We have no idea what your
vector is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll take her to three thousand meters. You'll have a

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's all I can give you, Yuri. After that . . .&quot;
His voice trailed off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm going off this frequency. Talk to you in
five.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Five minutes. Starting now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Androv pushed a switch on the console, then said, &quot;Petra,
stabilize at three thousand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>“Three thousand,”</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> she repeated. <i>“Confirmed.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He rose from the pilot's seat, motioning for Vance.
There was a surge of acceleration as the vehicle changed pitch, the cockpit
rotating to adjust for the G-forces. The weight of two and a half G's weighed
against them as the altimeter screen started scrolling upward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance walked across to the central seat, studying the
console. The throttle quadrant and sidestick he understood, but most of the
other controls were new to him. Maybe it didn't matter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Does Petra understand English?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course,&quot; Androv nodded. &quot;Russian,
Japanese, and English. Interchangeable. She's programmed such that if you
command her in Russian, she replies in Russian. If you use English, that's what
you get back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So far, so good.&quot; He looked at the large screen at
the end of cabin, the one that displayed Petra's mindstate. She was dutifully
announcing that she'd just taken the vehicle to three thousand meters. She also
was reporting the IR interrogation of a wing of MIG 31s flying at twenty thousand
feet, with a closure rate of three hundred knots. When Daedalus made her move,
would she be able to outdistance their air-to-air missiles?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We're about to find out, he thought, in—he glanced at the
screens—three and a half minutes. Eva was zipping up her pressure suit now,
readying to strap herself back into her seat. The helmet made her look like an
ungainly astronaut.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Like I said, the scramjets become operable at Mach
4.8,&quot; Androv went on. &quot;At forty thousand feet, that's about three
thousand miles per hour. I've never taken her past Mach 4.5.&quot; He was
grasping the side of the console to brace himself. &quot;You probably know that
scramjets require a modification in engine geometry. In the turboramjet mode,
these engines have a fan that acts as a compressor, just like a conventional
jet. However, when we switch them over to scramjet geometry, the turbines are
shut down and their blades set to a neutral pitch. Next the aft section of each
engine is constricted to form a combustion chamber—the shock wave inside
becomes the 'compressor.' &quot; He paused. &quot;The unknown part comes when
the fans are cut out and the engine geometry is modified. I've unstarted the
fans and reconfigured, but I've never fed in the hydrogen. We simply don't know
what will happen. Those damned turbines could just explode.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So we take the risk.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's more,&quot; he continued. &quot;The frictional
heat at hypersonic speeds. Our liquid hydrogen is supposed to act as a heat
sink, to dissipate thermal buildup on the leading edges, but who the hell knows
if it'll work. We're now flying at about fifteen hundred miles per hour. When
you give Petra the go-ahead, we could accelerate to ten, even fifteen thousand
miles per hour. God help us, we may just melt.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you were willing to give it a shot, then I am.&quot;
Vance looked up at the screens. &quot;We're now at ten thousand feet. I kick
over to scramjets at forty thousand?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The computer simulations all said that if we go hypersonic
below sixty thousand feet, we could seriously overheat. But maybe if we climb
out fast enough . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We'll have to take our chances. We need to minimize
that window of AAM vulnerability.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I agree.&quot; Androv gestured for him to sit, then
glanced up at the screens. &quot;We have two and a half minutes. I've set Petra
for full auto. All you have to do is just talk her through the key intervals of
the sequence.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance settled in and examined the huge flight helmet looming
above him, making him look like an alien insect from science fiction. Now the
cabin had taken on an eerie quiet, with nothing but silent screens flashing
data. He'd never talked to an airplane before, and the thought gave him some
disquiet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Two minutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do I do first?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You probably should start by attaching that nozzle
there on the legs of your G-suit to the pressure hose on the console. When the
G-forces go above eight, tubules in the legs automatically inflate using bleed
air from the engines. It's going to squeeze hell out of your lower extremities.
If you begin to gray-out, try to grunt as hard as you can. The M-l maneuver, I
think you Americans call it. If your vision begins to go entirely, just try and
talk Petra through.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What else?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Once you start pushing through the hypersonic barrier,
keep an eye on screens B-5 and B-6, which report engine strut temperature and
stress loads. Those are the most important data for the scramjet mode. But
first check the C-2 screen. Core rpm has to be zeroed out before the scramjet
geometry modification, since the compressors need to be completely shut down.
If it's not, then instruct Petra to abort the sequence. It could cause a
flameout.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And that's when I switch over to liquid hydrogen?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Exactly. Petra will set the new engine geometry, then
sample compression and temperature and tell you the precise moment. But the
actual switch-over is manual. I insisted on it.&quot; He pointed. &quot;It's
those blue toggles right behind the throttle quadrant. Just flip them
forward.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Got it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;After you toggle her over, just ease the throttle forward,
and pray.&quot; He settled himself into the right-hand seat, tugging at the
tourniquet. &quot;When we enter the hypersonic regime, I don't know what will
happen. Above Mach 6 or Mach 7 we may begin to critically overheat. Or the
airframe stresses could just tear this damned <i>samolyot</i>  apart. Whatever
happens, though, you've got to keep pushing her right on out, to stabilize the
shock wave in the scramjets and bring them to full power.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance glanced up at the screen—thirty seconds—and fingered
the sidestick and the throttles, trying to get their feel. As he began lowering
the massive flight helmet, he noted that with the engines on military power
they had exactly eighteen minutes of JP-7 left. When he kicked in the
afterburners to push them into the hypersonic regime, the fuel readings would
start dropping like a stone. But this was their ball of string, their way out
of the maze. Would it work?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Remember,&quot; Androv said with finality, &quot;just
talk Petra through any problems you have. And try to capture an attitude of
sixty degrees alpha . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yuri, are you ready for us to escort you back?&quot;
The radio voice, speaking Russian, sounded through the cabin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm still thinking it over,&quot; he answered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't be a fool. I have orders to down you with AA-9s.
My weapons system is already turned on. Warheads are locked. You're as good as
dead. If I push the fire button here under my left thumb, you're gone in fifty
seconds.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You just made up my mind,&quot; he said, and nodded toward
Vance. &quot;Go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Firing one and two,&quot; was the radio response.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>“<i>Yes,”</i> she answered in English.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Give me alpha sixty.&quot; He rammed the
throttles forward, clicking them into the Lock position, igniting the
afterburners. Next he yanked the sidestick into position.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The cockpit rotated upward, automatically shifting to
compensate for the changing G-forces. In front of his eyes now was a wide
liquid crystal screen that seemed to be in 3-D. The left side resembled the
heads-up display, HUD, common to jet Fighters, providing altitude, heading, airspeed,
G-forces in a single unified format. The right side showed a voice-activated
menu listing all the screens along the wall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Immediately the numbers appeared, in pounds of JP-7 and in
minutes, with and without afterburners. The G-force was now at 3.5 and
climbing, while the digital altimeter was spinning.</span></p>

hostile IR interrogation. Two bogies, closure rate nine hundred sixty knots.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>They weren't kidding, Vance thought. He glanced at
the altitude readout. Daedalus was hurtling through thirty thousand feet,
afterburners sizzling. But an AA-9 had a terminal velocity well over Mach 3.
Add that to the Foxhound's 2.4 . . .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&quot;Petra,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

rapidly, already down to twelve minutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Give me RWR and IRWR, screen one,&quot; he commanded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The liquid crystal panorama inside the helmet immediately
flashed, showing the unfriendly radar and infrared interrogations. The two
Acrid AA-9s—that's what they had to be—were gaining altitude, tracking them
like bloodhounds. One was radar locked, while the other showed active-homing IR
guidance. The exhausts of Daedalus's afterburners must look like a fireball in
the sky, he thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

capabilities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

could be confused, Daedalus had no way to defeat infrared homing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The left-hand display now showed they had accelerated to Mach
4.2. The throttle quadrant was locked into the afterburner mode, but outrunning
AAMs was like trying to outspeed a smart bullet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He watched the dials. Mach 4.3. Mach 4.4.</span></p>

color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not sure we're going to make it,&quot; he said into

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, it would be too risky,&quot; Androv replied.
&quot;The skin temperatures at this altitude. The air is still so dense the
thermal stresses . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance checked the screen again. &quot;Altitude is now
thirty-eight thousand feet. I'm going to level out some, try and boost our Mach
number. One thing's sure, we can't make it if we hold this attitude. Besides,
we're burning too much fuel. Either we chance it now, or we get blown to
smitherines. We've got no choice.&quot; He shoved the sidestick forward. For
this he didn't plan to bother with Petra.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>“Time to impact, twenty seconds,”</span></i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> she reported tonelessly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>By trimming pitch, Daedalus started accelerating
more rapidly. Airspeed scrolled quickly to Mach 4.6.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>“<i>Time to impact, fifteen seconds.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Nine and a half minutes of JP-7 remained. Just
enough to land, he thought, if we ever get the chance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mach 4.7.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he remembered Androv had said she might pass out. Now he
was starting to wonder if he wouldn't lose consciousness too. He was sensing
his vision starting to fade to gray, breaking up into dots. The screen noted
that their acceleration had reached eight G's and was still climbing. Fighting
for consciousness, he reached down and increased his oxygen feed, then
contracted every muscle in the lower half of his body, trying to shove the
blood upward. The G-indicator on the left-hand screen had scrolled to 9.2.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>“Time to impact, ten seconds.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He reached down and manually locked the pitch on the
compressor fan blades into a neutral configuration. They immediately stalled
out, causing <i>Daedalus </i>to shudder like a wounded animal. Then he heard
the voice of Petra, and a new signal flashed on his helmet screen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>“We have nominal scramjet geometry. Commence ignition
sequence.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She'd reconfigured the turbines, meaning <i>Daedalus </i>was
go for hypersonic. He grappled blindly behind the throttle quadrant and flicked
the large blue switches that initiated the hydrogen feed. But would the
supersonic shock wave inside the engines fire it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Let's go.&quot; Reaching for the throttle

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You okay?&quot; He rose and moved toward her. &quot;I
think I blacked out there for a second or so.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm going to make it.&quot; She shifted her eyes right.
&quot;But I'm not so sure about . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't worry.&quot; The Russian snapped conscious and
immediately reached to begin loosening his straps. &quot;I've been through
heavy G-loads before.&quot; Suddenly he stared up at the screens, pointed, and
yelled. &quot;Hypersonic! <i>Zoloto</i>! You didn't tell me. I almost can't
believe—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We almost lost it. Skin temperatures reached—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Japanese ceramic composites, my <i>droog</i>. No other
material could have done it. And now the atmosphere is thinning. When we hit
eighty thousand feet, or maybe eighty-five, skin temperature should stabilize
down around a thousand degrees. That's 'room temperature' for this
vehicle.&quot; He paused and grinned. &quot;Liquid hydrogen. It's a fantastic
fuel, and a terrific coolant. Of course, if this catches on and we stop using
alcohol coolant in our MiGs, I don't know what the Soviet Air Force will all
drink before payday.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance glanced at their vector. They were over the Bering Sea
now, with a heading for who knew where.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mach 11.3 and climbing. The Daedalus was pressing
effortlessly toward the darkness above. Time to think about what was next.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How much of this wonderful liquid hydrogen do we
have?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just enough to do what I've been planning for a long time.&quot;
He edged over and touched Vance's shoulder. &quot;I'm deeply in your debt. You
made it possible. Now there's only one thing left. The ultimate!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance looked at him and realized immediately what he meant.
Why not!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do we have enough oxygen?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Extra cannisters were loaded because of the two Mino
Industries pilots. I think we have about ten hours.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I vote we give it a shot,&quot; he said, turning
to Eva. &quot;What do you think?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He flipped up his helmet visor. &quot;If we can achieve Mach
25 by around a hundred thousand feet, we can literally insert into orbit. It'd
cause a diplomatic flap the size of World War Three.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She slumped back in her G-seat. &quot;Is it really
possible?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course,&quot; Androv said. Then he laughed.
&quot;Well, I hope so. I've been thinking about it for a couple of months now.
I actually programmed Petra to compute the precise thrust required, orbital
apogee and perigee, everything. The first Sputnik had an apogee of one hundred
miles and a perogee of one hundred twenty-five miles. I've calculated that at
Mach 25 I could propel this vehicle into roughly that orbit. To get out we can
just do a de-orbit burn. Set the compressors on the ramjets for retrofire and
cold-start them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So we can hold Tanzan Mino's cojones hostage for a
while and have some fun,&quot; Vance smiled. &quot;What do we tell Petra?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll give her the coordinates, but you've got to handle
the stick. We need to hit Mach 25 above 98,600 feet, then shut down the engines
with split-second timing. She'll tell you when. If I computed it right, we
should just coast over the top.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Got it.&quot; He looked up at the screens on the front
wall of the cockpit. Their altitude was now 87,000 feet, and then-speed had
reached Mach 18, over ten thousand miles per hour. They were cracking world
records every millisecond. And the cockpit was starting to cool off again as
the thinner atmosphere reduced friction on the leading edges. They'd survived
the thermal barrier. Coming up was the emptiness of space.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He watched as Androv called the routine in Petra's silicon
memory where he had stored the orbital data, then ordered her to coordinate it
with their current acceleration, altitude, and attitude.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Confirmed</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
she was saying. <i>Reducing alpha by two degrees.</i> She'd already begun
modifying their flight profile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2>         “You are approximately four minutes and
thirty-seven seconds from the calculated orbit. Will fuel controls be manual or
automatic?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance glanced over at Androv. Here at the edge of space, were
they really going to turn their destiny over to a talking computer? This game
could turn serious if Petra somehow screwed up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let's keep the throttles on manual.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I agree,&quot; he nodded. &quot;Too much could go
wrong.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If we don't like the looks of anything, we can always
abort.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Petra,&quot; Androv commanded, &quot;throttles will be
manual.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Affirmative</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. If she felt slighted, she wasn't saying anything. <i>Four
minutes.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We'd all better strap in,&quot; Vance said, &quot;till
we see how this goes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The screens above them were still flashing flight data. The
strut temperature in the scramjets, where a supersonic shock wave was providing
the compression to combust hydrogen and the rush of thin air, had stabilized at
3,100 degrees Fahrenheit. Androv stood staring at the screens, and a moistness
entered his eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If my father could have seen this,&quot; he finally
said in Russian. &quot;Everything he designed has worked perfectly. He dreamed
of this vehicle, talked of it for so many years, and now finally . . . to be
murdered on his day of triumph.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Eva looked at him. &quot;Maybe his real dream was for you to
fly it. To create something for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He paused, as though uncertain how to respond. The look in
his eyes said he knew it was true. The pain and anger seemed to flow through
him like electricity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Before we are finished, the world will know of his
achievement. I intend to make sure of it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>“Three minutes,”</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> Petra announced. <i>“Reducing alpha by three degrees.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The screen above reported that they'd reached Mach 22.4.
Their altitude was now ninety-three thousand feet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She's leveling out, Vance thought. Are we going to make it,
or just fade in the stretch?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The scramjets were punching through the isolation of
near-space now, the underfuselage scooping in the last fringes of atmosphere.
He doubted if there'd be enough oxygen above a hundred thousand feet to enable
the engines to continue functioning, but if they could capture the vehicle's
design speed, seventeen thousand miles per hour, they still could coast into
the perigee curve of a huge orbital elipse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked at the screens again. They were now at Mach 23.7,
with two and a half minutes left. The complex calculus being projected on
Petra's main display now showed their rate of acceleration was diminishing
rapidly as the atmosphere continued to thin. Maybe, he thought, there's a good reason
why no one has ever inserted an air-breathing vehicle into orbit before. Maybe
all the aerodynamic and propulsion tricks in the world can't compensate for the
fact that turbines need to breathe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Petra seemed to sense they were in trouble. <i>“Constricting
venturi by seven point three,”</i> she said. <i>“Reducing alpha by four
degrees.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was choking down the scramjets and leveling them out even
more. Their thrust to weight ratio—which at thirty thousand feet had been
greater than one, meaning they could actually fly straight up—was dropping like
a stone. It was now down to 0.2. Daedalus was slowly smothering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But now their velocity had reached Mach 24.6. Almost, almost
. . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>“Thirty seconds,” </span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Petra said, as though trying to sound confident. She was busy
sampling the combustion ratio in the scramjets and making micro adjustments to
the hydrogen feed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Androv spoke into his helmet mike. &quot;I'm beginning to
think we won't make it. Petra is now probably estimating thrust based on faulty
assumptions about oxygen intake. There's nothing left up here to burn. There'll
be no need to abort. The edge of the atmosphere is going to do it for us.&quot;
He looked up at the big screen and said, &quot;Petra, project image from the
nose camera, rotated to minus ninety.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>“Confirmed,”</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> she replied and flashed an image sprinkled with stars. Then
the camera swept around, and the massive screen at the end of their cabin
brought into view the edge of a wide globe that seemed to be composed of shimmering
blue. It was the North Pacific.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I just wanted to see this,&quot; he said wistfully.
&quot;I once took a MiG 25 to seventy-three thousand feet, but it was nothing
to compare. We're in space.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've been eavesdropping on satellites for years,&quot;
Eva commented. &quot;But this gives it all a whole new perspective.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>“Ten seconds. Prepare to terminate hydrogen feeds.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The airspeed indicator now read Mach 24.8. Closing. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance reached for the heavy throttle grips, watching the
final seconds tick down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. . . four, three, two, one . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>“Terminate hydrogen feeds.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He yanked back on the handles, feeling a dying tremor flow
through the vehicle. The airspeed indicator had just hit 17,108 mph.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the unearthly silence that followed, Petra's synthetic
voice cut through the cabin. <i>“Preliminary orbital coordinates are computed
as perigee 101.3 miles, apogee 117.8 miles. Duration is one hour and
twenty-seven minutes. Radar altimeter will provide data for second iteration of
calculations in thirty-six minutes.”</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The engines were completely shut down now as they
coasted through the dark. Nothing could be heard but hydraulic pumps, air
conditioners, light groans from zero-gravity-induced stresses in the massive
fuselage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Zadroka!</i>&quot; Androv shouted. &quot;We've done
it! Maybe there is a God.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now, as <i>Daedalus </i>began to slip sideways, like a liner
adrift at sea, the nose camera showed they were passing over the ice-covered
wilds of northern Alberta.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance felt a sudden rush of fluids from his extremities,
where they had been pooling because of the G-forces, upward into his face and
torso. The sensation was one of falling, hanging on to his seat. Clumsily he
unfastened his G-seat harness and pushed up to . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>    He sailed. Across the cockpit. At the last instant he
twisted, trying to right himself, but before he could he'd slammed into the
bank of video monitors on the opposite wall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jesus!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sweetie, you look like a flying fish.&quot; Eva drifted
back in her seat, loving him all over again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I feel like a newborn deer trying to stand up.&quot; He
rotated and carefully pushed himself off the ceiling, repressing the instinct
to kick like a scuba diver. &quot;But remember the old Chinese proverb. Don't
criticize a man till you've floated in his shoes for a day.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Darling, it's a dream come true. I'm finally
weightless,&quot; she laughed. &quot;At last, no more dreading to get on a
scale.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The pain in my arm is gone,&quot; Androv spoke up
again, renewed satisfaction in his voice. &quot;We've just performed our first
medical experiment in space. It's good for gunshot wounds.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd like to perform another experiment,&quot; Eva said.
She was slowly extracting herself from the G-seat. &quot;What kind of
electrical system do we have on board?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We have a massive battery section, kept charged by the
turbines,&quot; Androv replied. &quot;All these electronics require a lot of
power.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So we could transmit?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course. We're designed for that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you planning?&quot; Vance looked over as he
drifted back across the cockpit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;A small surprise for Tanzan Mino.&quot; She was
twisting around as she floated next to her straps. &quot;Let me start preparing
the laptop. I knew there was a reason why I brought it.&quot; She reached down
under the seat and pushed it out, where it floated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I want to hook this into Petra.&quot; She reached up
and awkwardly retrieved it. &quot;Is there any way I can?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's provision for laptop interface. They worked so
well on the American shuttles, our people installed an identical setup
here.&quot; Androv swam slowly to the console, then flipped down a panel,
revealing a serial port. &quot;You can connect it there. The wiring's in
place.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance twisted and checked their coordinates. They were now at
latitude 56 degrees, longitude 109 degrees, headed over central Canada.
&quot;Incidentally, so much for North American air defenses. No radar
interrogations whatsoever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;That's because of our Stealth design,&quot;
Androv said. &quot;We have almost no radar signature. Not only are we a menace
to the world, we're invisible.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance floated down and settled into the central G-seat. The
more he learned about the <i>Daedalus</i>, the more unsettling he found it.
What should they do with this monster? Maybe turn it over to the UN as a
monument to technology gone amuck, to high-tech excess. At last, he thought,
man has achieved the ability to move anywhere on the planet, at speeds as fast
as the laws of physics will allow, and do it invisibly. Maybe it should be
called the Shadow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay.&quot; Eva interrupted his thoughts. &quot;I've
finished tying in the Zenith. We're about to go live from the top, gentlemen,
the very top. I'm going to send the protocol to every wire service in the
world. What better credibility than to be downlinked live from space?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance looked at the picture from the nose camera. They were
over the Atlantic now, which meant they'd soon be passing over the Soviet
Union, with line-of-sight horizons that stretched from Europe to Asia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why settle for print?&quot; He had a sudden thought.
&quot;How about television? With all this video gear, we should be able to put
together something that would transmit. The Baikonur Cosmodrome has receiving
facilities. We see Soviet cosmonauts in space all the time. And they'll be directly
under us. We also could make the evening news all over Japan if we broadcast to
the Katsura tracking facility.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good thinking, but I've got an even better idea.&quot;
She seemed to pirouette in weightlessness. &quot;Japan already has DBS, direct
broadcast satellites, and there are home satellite dishes all over the country.
It's the Global Village. So why don't we just cut in for a special
bulletin?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why not.&quot; He pointed to the ill-fated cockpit
camera Tanzan Mino's technicians had installed above the entry hatch.
&quot;Matter of fact, we probably could just use that, if we could hook it into
some of the electronics here on the console.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He floated up, half drifting and half swimming, and inspected
the camera, convincing himself that it was still in working condition. And it
had to be wired into something. Maybe now all they needed to do was flip the
right toggles. The console switches numbered, by his conservative estimate,
approximately three hundred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me see what I can do.&quot; Androv floated down and
immediately started to work, toggling, testing, watching the display screens as
various messages were scrolled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Petra,&quot; he finally commanded in Russian,
&quot;give me a positive connect between UHF display-read and video output
terminal 3-K.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>“Interface confirmed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Suddenly a video screen fluttered, ran through a test series
of colored bars, then threw up a picture of the cockpit as seen from the camera
above the hatch. Vance studied the image of three figures floating in a
confined space outfitted with electronic hardware and a giant wing-shaped hood
over the central seat. On TV their cockpit looked like the flight deck of some
alien vessel in Star Trek IX.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're on.&quot; Eva waved at the camera. Her image on
the screen waved back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay,&quot; Vance said. &quot;Now for the tricky part.
Transmission.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Androv smiled as he drifted up again. &quot;That's actually
the easiest of all. Remember this vehicle was originally intended—supposedly—as
a near-earth research platform. There're plenty of downlinks, in keeping with
the need to transmit data, as well as general propaganda functions. We can use
any frequency you want, even commercial broadcast channels.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So why don't we go live worldwide? Just give everybody
an inside look at the planet's first radar-evasive space platform.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Petra has a listing of all commercial satellite
channels, just to make sure she doesn't inadvertently violate one of them with
a transmission. Let's pull them up and see what they are.&quot; He flipped
several toggles on the wide console, then told Petra what he wanted. He'd no
sooner finished speaking than the large screen that supplemented her voice was
scrolling the off-limits frequencies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay,&quot; Eva said. &quot;Let's start with the data
channels belonging to world-wide newsprint organizations— Reuters, the
Associated Press, all the rest—and send a copy of the protocol. It'll just
appear on every green screen in the world. Then we can pick off frequencies
used by television news organizations and broadcast a picture postcard from
here in the cockpit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sounds good.&quot; Androv turned to look at the screen.
Quickly he began selecting numbers from the banned list, moving them to a new
file that would be used to specify parameters for the broadcasts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Vance watched, shifting his glance occasionally to the view
from the nose camera. Below them clusters of light from central Europe's
largest cities beamed up, twinkling lightly through the haze of atmosphere. He
reached over and flipped the camera to infrared and sat watching the
back-radiation of the North African deserts, now blots of deep red on the
southern horizon; then back to visible again, noticing two parallel ribbons of
light that signified habitations along the length of the Nile. The world, he
was thinking, really is a Global Village. She was right. There's no longer any
place you can hide from the truth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Eva, when you feed the protocol to the wire services,
note that there'll be a transmission of some live video at—&quot; he glanced up
at the digital readouts on the screens, &quot;how about at 0800 hours, GMT?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's in twenty minutes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Should be enough time, don't you think?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sounds good to me. And to show you I'm brave, I won't
even fix my hair.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You never looked more beautiful, even that night out at</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>the palace.
Don't change a thing.&quot; He turned to Androv. &quot;How about doing the
talking? First in Russian and then in English? We'll write the English part for
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It will be my pleasure, Comrade. My fucking
pleasure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

the maze of Mino. We did too. It's easy. You just use your wings and fly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kenji Nogami settled the telephone back into its cradle and
reached for the television's remote selector. The set was currently scrolling a
special text being distributed over the Reuters financial-service channel. Very
interesting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He shoved aside the pile of new Mino Industries Eurobond
debentures, to make room for his feet on the teakwood surface of his desk. BBC
had just informed him they'd taped an accompanying video segment and were
planning to broadcast it in thirteen minutes, at nine o'clock. At least that's
what Sir Cecil Ashton, director general, had just warned. As the London banker
for Mino Industries, he had told Sir Cecil he officially had no comment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No comment was required.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He reached into a drawer and drew out a box of Montecristo
Habana No. 2s, noting sadly there were only three left. With a frown he picked
up his pocket Dictaphone and made a note to his secretary to stop off at the
tobacconists on Threadneedle, just down from the Bank of England, and get
another box.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A hypersonic aircraft. So that was what it had been about all
along. And now some Russian test pilot had stolen it, taken it to orbit, and
was planning to land it at Heathrow in three hours, there to turn it over to
Westminster Union Bank, the London financial representative of Mino Industries
Group.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Perfect timing. The thought immediately occurred to him that
this would be ideal collateral for the billions in phony Eurodollar debentures
he was being forced to issue for Tanzan Mino. Finally, finally he had the man
by the bollocks. Who, he wondered, did he have to thank for this godsend?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, it was shaping up to be quite a morning. Perhaps a
trifle early for a cigar, but . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He flicked the TV off the Reuters text and onto BBC-1.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;. . . would appear to be further evidence of the growing
technological supremacy of Japanese industry. As this commentator has had
occasion to note in times past, the lines between civilian and military
technology are rapidly vanishing. That Japan's so-called civilian research
sector could create the high-temperature ceramics required for such a vehicle,
even as European and American military research has failed to do so, speaks
eloquently of the emerging shift in world . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He rolled down the sound a bit. The commentator went on to
mention that all Mino Industries representatives— both here in London and in
Tokyo—named in the announcement from orbit had refused either to confirm or
deny the story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He noted the time on his Omega, then smiled, leaned back, and
snipped the end off his cigar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mino-sama.&quot; The man bowed low. &quot;NHK just telephoned
your office in Tokyo, asking for comment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Comment about what?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They have received some text off a satellite.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What? What did they receive?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It was purportedly the English translation of a secret
protocol, an agreement between Mino Industries and the Soviets. Naturally we
denied it in the strongest possible terms.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It has to be some preposterous fabrication. I can't
imagine how anything so absurd could have—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's actually the problem, Mino-sama. NHK says they
received it from a manned space station, but they've checked with NASDA and
have been assured there are currently no astronauts in orbit by any
nation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In orbit?&quot; My God, he thought. <i>Daedalus</i>
didn't go down; she went up. With the protocol aboard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How did they manage to get her hypersonic? Androv was
wounded. He couldn't possibly have handled the G-forces. Which meant—</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Vance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell NHK if they broadcast one word of this libelous,
unsubstantiated hoax, they should be prepared to face legal action.&quot; His
face had become a stone mask as a sepulchral hush settled over Flight Control.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I will inform them,&quot; the man bowed again. He
hadn't had the courage to tell the <i>oyabun</i> the rest of what NHK was now
receiving . . . along with half of the citizens of Japan via their new
direct-broadcast satellite dishes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=bookmark102><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kenji Nogami thought the picture was a little indistinct at
first, the hues slightly off. But then somebody in BBC's technical section
corrected the color balance, making the tape's blues and greens and reds all
blue and green and red.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, now he could make it out. A cosmonaut was drifting
across the camera's view, suspended. It made him ponder briefly the phenomenon
of weightlessness. Curious, really, that it was all a matter of where you were.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One wall of the cockpit was lined with video terminals, and
at the end was a massive screen currently displaying the Daedalus Corporation
logo, a double ax. Nice advertising, he thought. Coca-Cola probably feels
envious. Overall it was a classy job, no two ways about it. The <i>oyabun </i>didn't
do things by halves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Well, this was one marvel Her Majesty's government
would be happy to get their hands on. For his own part, not a bad piece of
collateral. Must have cost billions in start-up investment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he got a better look at the figure and realized</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>something
was wrong. One side of his white environment suit was stained red. And he
seemed to be nursing a bandaged arm as he drifted up toward the camera.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;<i>Stradstyve</i>,&quot; he began, &quot;<i>Ya Yuri
Andreevich Androv</i>. . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The cosmonaut then proceeded to deliver a
long-winded speech in Russian that Nogami could not follow and the BBC had not
yet translated. He seemed to be growing angrier and angrier, and at one point
he gave a long disquisition about someone named Andrei Petrovich Androv. He was
obviously a Soviet test pilot. Who else could fly that creation? Given the
looks of the cockpit, it was a quantum advance in high technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nogami leaned back, his match poised. The good part, the part
in English, was coming up. That's what Sir Cecil had said. The Russian segment
had been for broadcast in the Soviet Union, had the local spin. The English
part was for the world. And for Tanzan Mino.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Who was now in deep, deep trouble. Murder, fraud, a global
conspiracy—they all were there, and even more damning for the way the story had
come to light. The medium was the message.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>About that time the cosmonaut who'd identified himself as
Soviet Air Force Major Yuri Andreevich Androv drifted to the side, permitting a
better view of the cockpit. That's when Nogami noticed two other individuals.
One appeared to be a woman—leave it to the Soviets, he smiled, to know about
good public relations—also wearing an environment suit, her helmet momentarily
turned away. The third appeared to be male, also in an environment suit and
flight helmet. Sir Cecil hadn't bothered mentioning them, since Air Force Major
Androv had done all the talking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the male cosmonaut in the center drifted up and began
opening his visor, some kind of curved glass that reflected the yellow sodium
lights in the ceiling. He grappled with it a moment, then in annoyance just
yanked it off and tossed it to drift across—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nogami stared at the face. Mother of God!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was laughing so hard he almost missed his Montecristo when
he finally whipped up his match. . . .</span></p>
